<div id="faqlist">
<p>
The mission of Soybean And Corn Advisor is to provide our readers with the most up-to-date information about soybean and corn production that you can't find anywhere else.  On this site, you will find articles that deal primarily with soybean and corn production in South America, but we will also inform our readers about other crops such as wheat, cotton, and sugarcane in addition to alcohol and biodiesel production.   The Soybean and Corn Advisor does not trade the commodity markets or give trading advice and we never have a position in the markets.  This allows us to supply accurate information to our readers regardless of market activity.
</p>
<p>
The Soybean And Corn Advisor offers a variety of services including: Website, Newsletter, Premier Service, and Presentations.
