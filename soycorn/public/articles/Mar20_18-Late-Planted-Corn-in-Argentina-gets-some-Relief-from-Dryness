Late Planted Corn in Argentina gets some Relief from Dryness
<p>
Some rain did fall across a narrow band in the core production area of Argentina, but I do not think it was enough to change the overall weather pattern, at least for now.
</p>
<p>
	Before the rains over this past weekend, the overall corn crop in Argentina was rated approximately 75% poor to very poor and 87% short to very short on soil moisture.  The early planted corn is 58% mature and 8% harvested.  Any rain at this point will not help the early planted corn which is approximately 40% of Argentina's corn crop this year.

<p>
	The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange estimates that 8% of the corn has been harvested and they are estimating the early corn yields thus far at 6,590 kg/ha (101.4 bu/ac) which is up 0.1 bu/ac from their estimate last week (see table below).

The later planted corn (approximately 60% of the total corn crop) is in worse condition than the early corn with 86% of the crop rated poor to very poor and 96% rated short to very short on soil moisture.  The later planted corn is now 20% filling grain.  Some of the latest planted corn could probably be helped a little by additional rainfall, but any additional rainfall needs to occur within the next 2-3 weeks.

	The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange left their 2017/18 corn estimate unchanged at 34.0 million tons.  The Rosario Exchange lowered their estimate to 32.0 million tons based on a harvested area of 5.36 million hectares and a nationwide yield of 5,980 kg/ha (92.0 bu/ac).
