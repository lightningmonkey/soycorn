Water Levels at Rosario, Argentina Expected to Continue Declining
<p>
The ongoing drought in central Brazil continues to be of great concern for exporters at the Port of Rosario in Argentina.  The water level has been dropping for several months and it is already to the point that vessels cannot leave the port fully loaded due to the limited draft of the river.  The situation is bound to get worse due to the deepening drought in Brazil.

	When a similar situation occurred last year, the governments of Brazil and Paraguay agreed to increase the discharge of the Itaipu Dam to increase the flow of the Parana River.  The Brazilian government may be reluctant to agree to a similar diversion this year since they are already warning of possible electricity shortages due to the low water level at the dam.
