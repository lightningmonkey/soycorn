Areas of Concern for the 2015 U.S. Crops
<p>
	While there are still lingering problems associated with the heavy rains that fell in the eastern Corn Belt starting in late May, the recent dry weather has benefited those regions.  I now think the focus is shifting somewhat to the hotter and dryer weather that has developed both in the eastern Corn Belt and in the western Corn Belt.	
</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems of slow development and stunted crops in the eastern Corn Belt associated with the previous saturated conditions including a loss of nitrogen.</li>
<li>Potential for increased disease pressures.  For corn the potential problems could be from northern corn leaf blight, grey leaf spot, and anthracnose.  For soybeans the potential problems could be from sudden death syndrome and while mold. </li>
<li>Shallow rooted crops in the eastern Corn Belt that could make the crops more susceptible to dry conditions, if they were to develop.</li>
<li>A drying trend and higher temperatures in the western and northwestern Corn Belt especially in northwestern Iowa, southwestern Minnesota, and eastern South Dakota. </li>
<li>Dryer than normal conditions and high temperatures in the southern U.S. from the Delta all the way to the Southeast Coast (Louisiana to North Carolina).</li>
