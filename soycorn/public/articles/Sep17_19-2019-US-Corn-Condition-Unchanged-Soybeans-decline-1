	A lot of the corn development is approximately two weeks behind the average pace, so the current warmer temperatures are welcomed.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The 2019 U.S. soybean condition declined 1% last week to 54% rated good to excellent.

Most of the improvements were found in the central locations while most of the declines were found in the eastern and western.

	Hotter and dryer weather in the eastern and southern areas led to most of the soybean declining conditions.  The state reports from Indiana and Ohio both mentioned that the soybean crop was suffering from dry conditions.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture improved last week with 6 states indicating improved soil moisture and 12 states indicating lower soil moisture.

	Even though there were only 6 states with higher soil moisture this week, those six are generally big production states and the soil moisture really shot up in those states.  The soil moisture in South Dakota is now 100% adequate to surplus, Wisconsin is 98%, North Dakota is 97%, Minnesota is 97%, and Nebraska is 90%.  In contrast, Indiana is 46% short to very short, Ohio is 41%, Illinois is 37%, and the mid-South and Delta are over 70% short to very short on moisture.
