2020/21 Brazil Soybeans 59% Harvested vs. 71.7% Last Year
<p>
	The 2020/21 Brazilian soybeans were 59.3% harvested late last week compared to 71.7% last year according to Patria Agronegocios.  This represents an advance of 13.5% for the week.  Mato Grosso was 91.7% harvested compared to 93.5% average and Parana was 58% harvested compared to 80% average.

	The weather in Brazil last week was dryer across central Brazil and wetter in far southern Brazil especially in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, which I think was generally good news for both regions.  Some areas of Mato Grosso continue to receive excessive rains with at least four cities in the state declaring states of emergency.

<p>
	The forecast for this week is calling for dryer weather in south-central Brazil and more chances of rainfall in Rio Grande do Sul.  The soybeans in Rio Grande do Sul are still filling pods, so any additional rainfall would be beneficial.  This is a good forecast for soybean harvesting, but not so good for the safrinha corn crop - more on that later.

<b>Mato Grosso Soybeans</b> - The soybeans in Mato Grosso were 91.7% harvested late last week compared to 98.3% last year and 93.5% average.  The soybean harvest reached 50% complete approximately 18 days later than last year.  Most of the soybeans left to harvest are in the south-central region of the state.

Below is the graph from the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) showing the soybean harvest pace in Mato Grosso.  The red line is 2020/21, the blue line is 2019/20, the dotted line is average, and the green area is the maximum and minimum over the last 5 years.

<b>Parana Soybeans</b> - The soybeans in Parana were 58% harvested last week compared to 80% average.  The weather has turned dryer in Parana, so the harvest pace is expected to accelerate.
</p>
<p>
<b>Rio Grande do Sul Soybeans</b> - The soybeans in Rio Grande do Sul were 5% harvested late last week compared to 25% last year and 16% average according to Emater.  This represents an advance of 4% for the week.  The soybeans are 59% filling grain and 24% maturing.

<p>
	Rainfall across the state last week benefited the soybeans, but the coverage was uneven and more is needed in some areas.  Fortunately, the forecast is calling for more chances of rain this week.

<p>
	In their latest weekly report, AgRural stated that their soybean production estimate for the state of Mato Grosso could decline in their next monthly crop report scheduled to be released before the end of March.  The lower estimate is due to excessive rainfall during harvest.
