Brazil's Bioenergy Concerned about Gov's Commitment to Research
<p>
	The bioenergy sector in Brazil is very concerned about the federal government commitment to research on traditional ethanol production and second generation ethanol production.  Their concern arises from the recent dismissal of 20 researchers from the National Science and Technology Ethanol Laboratory (CTBE) by the Brazilian Minister of Science and Technology.  The official reason for the dismissals was a lack of funding.

<p>
 	The president of the Brazilian Bioenergy Producers Association (Udop) is concerned that these layoff could impact research in the entire clean energy sector including ethanol, biodiesel, biogas, and other clean energies.

	Sugar/ethanol mill owners are concerned that the CBTE laboratory may eventually be shut down, jeopardizing promising ongoing research projects.  In addition to the Brazilian Bioenergy Producers Association, more than 20 groups of sugar/ethanol mills work closely with the laboratory on bioenergy research.
