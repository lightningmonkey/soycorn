The weather during the growing season was very favorable until the last two weeks when rain delayed the timely completion of the soybean harvest.  Some farmers finished harvesting their grain at moisture levels higher than normal, but they were willing to be docked the cost of drying at the local grain elevator in exchange for knowing that their soybeans were out of the field.
