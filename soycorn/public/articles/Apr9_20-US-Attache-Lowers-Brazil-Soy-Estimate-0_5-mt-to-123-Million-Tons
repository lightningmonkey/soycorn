U.S. Attach&eacute; Lowers Brazil Soy Estimate 0.5 mt to 123.0 Million Tons
<p>
	The U.S. agricultural attach&eacute; in Brazil recently lowered their estimate of the 2019/20 Brazilian soybean crop by 0.5 million tons to 123.0 million.  The reduction was the result of a severe drought in Rio Grande do Sul that has reduced soybean yields in the state by as much as 40% or more.  The 2019/20 soybean production in other states of Brazil, such as Mato Grosso and Goias, ended up being very positive, but they could not completely compensate for the losses in southern Brazil.
</p>
<p>
	The current estimate from the USDA is that Brazil will produce 126.0 million tons of soybeans in 2019/20, but the USDA will release their latest monthly estimate of the Brazilian soybean production on April 9th.
</p>
<p>
	The attach&eacute; is estimating that Brazil will export 77 million tons of soybeans in 2020, which is up 2 million tons from their previous estimate due to the devaluation of the Brazilian currency.  The Brazilian real has devalued approximately 35% since the start of 2020 making Brazilian exports very competitive in world markets.
</p>
<p>
	Looking ahead to the 2020/21 Brazilian soybean crop, the attach&eacute; is estimating that Brazilian farmers will increase their soybean acreage from the current 37.0 million hectares to 38.5 million hectares (95.0 million acres) or 4%.  They feel that farmers will be aggressive with their inputs pushing the nationwide soybean yield to 3,350 kg/ha (49.5 bu/ac).  As a result, the 2020/21 Brazilian soybean production is estimated at 129.0 million tons. Brazilian soybean exports in 2021 are expected to be 79 million tons.
</p>
<p>
	Brazil has cemented its position as the world's number one soybean producer and exporter.
</p>
<p>
	Going forward, the attach&eacute; feels that Brazil will lose some Chinese soybean imports to the United States as the Chinese try to fulfill their commitment under the Phase 1 trade agreement, but that will only be a temporary obstacle for Brazilian soybean exports.
