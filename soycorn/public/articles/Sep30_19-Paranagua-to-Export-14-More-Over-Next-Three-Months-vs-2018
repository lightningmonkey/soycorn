Paranagua to Export 14% More Over Next Three Months vs. 2018
<p>
	The Port of Paranagua in southern Brazil is expected to receive over six million tons of grain, soybean meal, and sugar during the last three months of 2019.  Port authorities estimate that during the last three months of 2019, they will receive 6.12 million tons for export, which would be 14% more than the 5.26 million tons received during the same period last year.

	By the end of December they expect to receive enough grain, soybean meal, and sugar to load approximately 100 vessels.  They expect that 70% of the grain will arrive by truck (4.27 million tons) and 30% by rail (1.83 million tons).  Each truck carries an average of 36 tons, so they are expecting 118,600 deliveries by truck during the last three months of the year.  Each railcar carries 55 tons, so they are expecting 33,272 railcars during the next three months.

	The port continues to improve the channel leading to the port and the draft at the public berths allowing for the loading of larger vessels.  They have also improved the delivery system at the public corridor.  Each of the two public silos can unload 4 trucks and 6 railcars simultaneously.

	Over the next three months, the port is expecting 2.69 million tons of soybeans, 1.16 million tons of soybean meal, 1.37 million tons of corn, and 0.9 million tons of sugar.

<p>
	There are 11erminals operating at the port including:  AGTL, Cargill, Centro Sul, Cimbessul, Coamo, Contriguacu, Interalli, Louis Dreyfus, Rocha, Bunge, Pasa, and the Public Silos where companies operate who do not have their own terminals.
</p>
<p>
	The port continues to undergo major improvements in its infrastructure to improve its efficiency and lower its cots.  They are undergoing these investments in order to stay competitive with the new "Northern Arc" of ports on the Amazon River and along the northern Atlantic Coast of Brazil.
