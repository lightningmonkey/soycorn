Mexican Veterinarians visiting Meat Processing Facilities in Brazil
<p>
	A group of veterinarians from Mexico are in Brazil inspecting meat processing facilities for beef, hogs, and poultry.  The group is inspecting the facilities in preparation for importing meat from Brazil into Mexico.  The group will be in Brazil until February 8.

<p>
During the visit, the group will inspect a total of 11 meat processing facilities in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul.

It may a coincidence or it might not be, but the new American administration has threatened to renegotiate NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) and maybe the visit of Mexican veterinarians is in preparation to source meat products from countries other than the U.S.
