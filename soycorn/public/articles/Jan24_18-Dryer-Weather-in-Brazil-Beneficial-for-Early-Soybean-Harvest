Dryer Weather in Brazil beneficial for early Soybean Harvest
<p>
	<b>Brazil Soybeans</b> - The weather last week in central and eastern Brazil was dryer, which favored the early soybean harvest especially in Mato Grosso.  The dryer conditions are beneficial in the short term, but dry weather in eastern and northeastern Brazil is a little worrisome.
</p>
<p>
In northeastern Brazil, the rainy season starts later and it ends earlier than in other regions of Brazil, which is why northeastern Brazil is a semi-arid region.  The region had good rains during December and early January, so dryness is not a problem right now.  A short period of dryness would not cause major problems, but the region will need additional rainfall going forward.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to dry weather, continued wetness across southern Brazil is becoming a larger concern especially in the states of Parana and Santa Catarina.  Overall, the Brazilian soybean crop is still rated in generally good condition.
</p>
<p>
The nationwide soybean harvest in Brazil is 0.8% complete according to AgRural.  This compares to 2.2% last year and the 5-year average of 1.2%.
</p>
<p>
The first state to harvest soybeans is Mato Grosso and the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported that the soybean harvest in the state was 3.3% complete as of last Friday.  This compares to 11.5% last year and the 5-year average of 7.1%.  The harvest is most advanced in western Mato Grosso where 7.5% of the soybeans have been harvested (last year 20.4% had been harvested). The least advanced is northeastern Mato Grosso where the harvest has not yet started.  Early yields are reported to be satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
	The soybean harvest has not yet started in Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias, and Parana even though there are usually some soybeans harvested by this point in January.  Dry weather in September and October delayed the soybean planting in those states, and as a result, the soybean harvest will start in February.

<p>
	<b>Brazil Corn</b> - Rio Grande do Sul is one of the largest full-season corn producing states along with Minas Gerais, but wet weather in the state is slowing the start of the early corn harvest.  While wet weather may slow the early harvest, it is seen as very beneficial for the later developing corn in the state.
</p>
<p>
	Harvesting of the full-season corn has just gotten started with AgRural reporting that 1% of the full-season corn has been harvested compared to the 5-year average of 2%.  Nationwide, 0.8% of the safrinha corn has been planted according to AgRural compared to 2.8% last year and the 5-year average of 1.1%.
</p>
<p>
In the state of Mato Grosso Imea is reporting that 1.4% of the safrinha corn has been planted compared to 4.6% last year.  The 5-year average is also 1.4%.  The wet weather in Parana is delaying the early soybean harvest even more than what had been anticipated and as a result, no soybeans have been harvested in the state and no safrinha corn has been planted.
