The top five rated corn states are:  Minnesota, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois.  The five lowest rated corn states are:  Colorado, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Ohio.

<p>
	The decline in the corn condition is the result of the ongoing dry weather in many areas and the impact from the derecho storm.  The corn condition in Iowa declined 9% G/E, Nebraska declined 7%, and Michigan declined 11%.

	Soybeans are sensitive to dry weather in August and many of the dryer areas are going to end the month of August with only about 25% of their monthly rainfall for the month.  The soybean condition in Michigan declined 10% G/E, South Dakota declined 10% G/E, and Iowa declined 6% G/E.

<p>
	The nation's soil moisture declined for the third week in a row which was no surprise given the lack of rainfall during August in many locations.  Temperatures are again above normal in many areas which is leading to additional moisture stress.  The soil moisture in Iowa is rated 76% short to very short, Nebraska is 64% short to very short, Michigan is 63% short to very short, and Ohio is 60% short to very short.
