Safrinha Corn Planting in Mato Grosso do Sul Ends Five Weeks Late
<p>
	There is growing concern in Brazil that the current dryer than normal weather pattern could negatively impact the 2020/21 safrinha corn yields.  The dry weather is especially important this growing season since the safrinha corn was planted much later than normal due to the delayed soybean harvest.

	Planting of the safrinha corn in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul started on January 29th and ended on April 16th, which is approximately five weeks after the ideal planting window had closed.  Generally, the ideal planting window closes about the third or fourth week of February.  Approximately 56% of the safrinha corn in the state was planted before the window closed with 44% planted as much as five weeks after it closed.

Corn planted that late runs an increased risk of running out of moisture before it matures due to the onset of the annual dry season as well as the possibility of frosts before it matures.

	The Agriculture and Livestock Federation of Mato Grosso do Sul (Famasul) estimates that farmers in the state increased their safrinha corn acreage by 5.7% to 2.0 million hectares.  They estimated the statewide corn yield at 75 sacks per hectare (71.5 bu/ac) with a total production of 9.0 million tons.

	Brazilian farmers increased their safrinha corn acreage due to the record high domestic corn prices.  Corn prices in Mato Grosso do Sul have increased 11% thus far in April and now are in the range of R$ 90.00 per sack (approximately $7.45 per bushel).  Farmers in Mato Grosso do Sul have forward contracted 34% of their anticipated corn production.

<p>
	The safrinha crop accounts for about three quarters of Brazil's total corn production.  The state of Mato Grosso do Sul is the third leading producer accounting for about 13% of the safrinha corn production.  The state of Mato Grosso is the leading producer with 44% of the production followed by Parana with 16%.
