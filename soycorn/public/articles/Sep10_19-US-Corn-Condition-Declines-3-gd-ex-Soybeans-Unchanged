	After two weeks of improving soil moisture, there has now been two weeks of declining soil moisture.  The forecast is calling for more rainfall across the northern states where there is already adequate to surplus soil moisture.  The forecast is calling for less rainfall in the central and eastern Corn Belt where they could use some additional moisture.
