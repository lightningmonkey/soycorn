June Planted Report will Probably not have Complete Planting Data
<p>
Unfortunately we will not know the full extent of prevented planting in time for the June Planting Report.  The survey for the June Planted Report is conducted during the first ten days of June and it is conceivable that some farmers will still be undecided about their final planting decisions when the survey is conducted.

	Additionally, the full extent of the severe flooding along the Mississippi River will probably not be known in time to be fully accounted for in the June report.  I suspect that the USDA will conduct a special acreage survey in the affected areas to be included in the August Crop Report.  This is a common practice during years when extensive flooding and standing water prevents the crops from being planted in a timely fashion.
