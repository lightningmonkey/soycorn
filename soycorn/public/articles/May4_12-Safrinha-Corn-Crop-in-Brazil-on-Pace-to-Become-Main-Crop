Safrinha Corn Crop in Brazil on Pace to Become Main Crop
<p>
	Year after year, Brazilian farmers continue to increase their <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage while at the same time they continue to reduce their full-season corn acreage.  The word <i>safrinha</i> in Portuguese means "little harvest" and the name was certainly appropriate in years past, but the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop is now nearly as large as the full-season corn crop in Brazil.
</p>
<p>
In 2005, Brazil harvested 7.0 million tons of <i>safrinha</i> corn compared to 27 million tons of full-season corn.  Today, the <i>safrinha</i> acreage is nearly the same as the full-season acreage and Conab is estimating that the 2011/12 <i>safrinha</i> corn crop will be 25.8 million tons compared to 35.8 for the full-season corn crop.  The <i>safrinha</i> production is up 20% compared to the 21.4 million tons produced last year while the full-season production is very similar to last year.

<p>
The increase in Mato Grosso <i>safrinha</i> acreage alone is very impressive.  Farmers in the state planted 2.4- 2.5 million hectares, which is approximately 38% more than last year.  Total <i>safrinha</i> production in the state could surpass 11 million tons or over 50% more than last year.  According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), approximately 70% of the anticipated <i>safrinha</i> corn production in the state has already been sold compared to 32% sold last year at this time.
</p>
<p>
The reasons for the increase in <i>safrinha</i> production include:  strong corn prices due to tight world supplies, a weakening Brazilian currency which increases prices for Brazilian farmers when they sell their crops, an ever increasing planting of early-maturing soybeans (90 to 95 day maturity) which allows more time to plant a second crop of corn, and seed companies developing corn hybrids suited for <i>safrinha</i> planting.
</p>
<p>
	Mato Grosso is the largest producer of <i>safrinha</i> corn followed by Parana, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goias and those three states are expected to produce 6.7 million tons, 3.9 million, and 3.1 million respectively.
