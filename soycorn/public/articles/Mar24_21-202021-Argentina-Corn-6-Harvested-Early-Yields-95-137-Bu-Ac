2020/21 Argentina Corn 6% Harvested, Early Yields 95-137 Bu/Ac
<p>
	Recent rains have helped the later planted corn and any additional rainfall this week would benefit the later planted corn which is in the process of filling grain.  I view the recent rains in Argentina as stabilizing the corn crop.

	Farmers in Argentina have harvested about 6% of their corn with early yields in the range of about 6,000 to 8,600 kg/ha (approximately 95 to 137 bu/ac).  In the core production area, the corn is approximately 15-25% harvested.  The corn harvest has not started in southern Argentina or northern Argentina.  The early panted corn was 59% mature and 12% harvested while the later planted corn was 33% filling grain

	The 202021 corn in Argentina was rated 22% poor/very poor, 56% fair, and 22% good/excellent as of late last week.  The good/excellent percentage compares to 17% last week and 35% average.  The soil moisture for the corn was rated 33% short/very short and 67% favorable/optimum.  The favorable/optimum percentage compares to 59% last week and 70% last year.
