Weather in Southern Brazil Could be Problematic for Safrinha Corn
<p>
Meteorologist in Brazil are warning that the autumn weather in southern Brazil during La Nina years could be cauterized by irregular rainfall and colder than normal temperatures.  The Environmental Technical and Monitoring System of Parana (Simepar) is forecasting that starting in May, waves of cold and dry air should move into southern Brazil with greater frequency and intensity.

According to meteorologists from Simepar, cold temperatures generally arrive earlier during years with La Nina and that there could be frosts as early as late May.  In fact, there have already been temperatures as low as 6 C (43 F) in Parana during February.

An earlier than normal frost would be a concern for the safrinha corn in both Parana and southern Mato Grosso do Sul.  The safrinha corn was planted very late with 88% planted as of earlier last week according to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral).  The other second crop in Parana is wheat, but the wheat crop should not be negatively impacted by cold temperatures.

The greatest threat for safrinha corn is in western Parana and southern Mato Grosso do Sul.  Safrinha corn planted in mid-March would pollinate about mid-May and mature in mid-July.
