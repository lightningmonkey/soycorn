U.S. Corn and Soybean Planting Continue ahead of the Average Pace
<p>
	In their most recent Crop Progress Report, the USDA reported that 92% of the 2015 U.S. corn crop had been planted as of Sunday, May 24.  This compares to 86% planted last year and 88% average.  The states where farmers are furthest behind in corn planting include:  Texas, Colorado, Kansas, and Missouri.  It is no surprise that corn planting is delayed in these states because that is the area of heavy rains in recent weeks.  The 2015 corn crop is 74% emerged compared to the average of 62%.

	The first condition rating of the corn crop indicated 74% good to excellent (62% good and 12% excellent).  This is a little less than last year when the first rating was 76% good to excellent (63% good and 13% excellent).

In the eastern Corn Belt (Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan) the soybeans are 69% planted compared to an average of 51%.  The 2015 soybean crop is 32% emerged compared to the average of 25%.

	The first rating for the U.S. soybean crop will be released either on Monday, June 1 or Monday June 8 and it is expected to be slightly less than the corn rating.  Last year, the first soybean rating was 74% good to excellent (62% good and 12% excellent).
