2011 Safrinha Corn Harvest 80% Complete
<p>
	The harvest of the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in Brazil is approaching 80% complete, which is just slightly slower than the 85% harvested last year at this time.  In the center-west states of Mato Grosso and Goias the harvest is complete and in Mato Grosso do Sul it is 75% complete.  Late planting and the early onset of the dry season negatively impacted the corn crop in Mato Grosso, which is the largest producer of <i>safrinha</i> corn in Brazil.

<p>
	The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) estimate that the <i>safrinha</i> corn yields in Mato Grosso fell to 3,900 kg/ha (60 bu/ac) and that the latest planted corn was the most adversely affected.  The yields of some of the latest corn harvested in Mato Grosso fell to 3,000 kg/ha or just 46 bu/ac.

	The remaining areas of <i>safrinha</i> corn to be harvested are the states of Parana (62% harvested) and Sao Paulo (58% harvested).  A significant portion of the <i>safrinha</i> corn in Parana is expected to be of very poor quality due to a series of freezing temperatures that hit the crop while it was still early in its grain filling process.

	Strong domestic corn prices are very attractive for farmers in Brazil who have already indicated that they intend to increase their <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in 2012.  Imea is estimating that farmers in Mato Grosso will plant 2 million hectares of <i>safrinha</i> corn in 2012, which would be a 14% increase over the 1.7 million hectares planted in 2011.
