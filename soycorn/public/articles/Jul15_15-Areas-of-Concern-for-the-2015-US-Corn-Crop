Areas of Concern for the 2015 U.S. Crops
<ul>
<li>Excessive moisture in the central, eastern, and southern Corn Belt resulting in slow development and stunted crops, both corn and soybeans. </li>
<li>Ponding and standing water in the central and eastern Corn Belt resulting in drowned-out corn and soybeans.  The drowned-out areas are now generally too late to replant.</li>
<li>Loss of nitrogen due to the wet conditions.</li>
<li>Potential for increased disease pressures.  For corn the potential problems could be from northern corn leaf blight, grey leaf spot, and anthracnose.  For soybeans the potential problems could be from sudden death syndrome and while mold. </li>
<li>Shallow rooted crops due to excessive moisture that could make the crops more susceptible to dry conditions if they were to develop.</li>
<li>A drying trend and higher temperatures in the western and northwestern Corn Belt.</li>
<li>Dryer than normal conditions and high temperatures in the southeastern U.S. (North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) which has already impacted the corn and soybeans.</li>
</ul>
