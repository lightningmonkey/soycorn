Port Strike in Argentina Ends as Government Agrees to Vaccinations
<p>
A second strike within two weeks by port workers in Argentina ended this week after the government agreed to give priority to port workers for Covid-19 vaccinations.  The strike last week lasted 48-hours and paralyzed port activities.  The strike this week lasted one day and involved 11 different unions at the port.

	Port workers insisted that they are essential workers since agricultural exports is a major source of revenue for the federal government.  Prior to the port workers being given priority, the other groups in Argentina that received priority for vaccinations were health care workers, politicians, and educators.

The Covid-19 infection rate in Argentina is very severe.  The union that went on strike last week indicated that they had lost four members to Covid-19 during the previous week.  Nationwide, the government announced that 75,588 Argentinians had died from Covid-19 out of a population of approximately 43 million.

	Argentina is the world's largest exporter of soybean meal and soybean oil and third largest exporter of soybeans and a major exporter of corn.

In neighboring Brazil, the government has started to vaccinate workers at the Port of Santos, which is the largest port in South America.
