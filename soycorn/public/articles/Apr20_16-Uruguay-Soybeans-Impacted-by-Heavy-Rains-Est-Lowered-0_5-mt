Uruguay Soybeans Impacted by Heavy Rains, Est. Lowered 0.5 mt
<p>
The heavy rains that have impacted Argentina and southern Brazil have also impacted soybean producers in Uruguay as well.  The normal rainfall in Uruguay during the month of April is approximately 100 mm (4 inches), but the rainfall thus far during April has been 400-800 mm (16 to 32 inches).  As a result, the soybean harvest has been completely suspended for several weeks and farmers are concerned about the quality of the crop as well as the yields.

When farmers finally get back into the field, they are going to report a lot of problems with their soybeans.  As a result, the 2015/16 Uruguay soybean estimate was lowered this week by 0.5 million tons to 3.0 million and I expect the number to move lower once farmers get back into the fields to assess the damage.
