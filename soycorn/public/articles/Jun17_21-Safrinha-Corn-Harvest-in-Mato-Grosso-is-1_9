Safrinha Corn Harvest in Mato Grosso is 1.9%
<p>
	The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) announced that 1.9% of the 2020/21 safrinha corn in the state has been harvested compared to 8.3% last year and 10.4% average.  A delay in harvesting the first crop of soybeans caused the delay in planting the 5.68 million hectares of safrinha corn (14.0 million acres).  Mato Grosso is the largest safrinha corn producing state in Brazil responsible for more than 45% of the total production.

	The harvest is most advanced in the mid-north region of the state where 2.7% of the corn has been harvested.  The slowest harvest pace is in the southern region of the state where only 0.3% of the corn has been harvested.  A large percentage of the corn is still filling grain and the harvest will peak during the second half of July.

	Spot corn prices in the state declined 1.3% compared to a week earlier to an average of R$ 73.28 per sack (approximately $6.30 per bushel).  Farmers in the state have sold 77% of their anticipated corn production, which is up 3.5% compared to a month earlier.  The average price for the forward corn sales is R$ 70.26 per sack (approximately $6.15 per bushel).
