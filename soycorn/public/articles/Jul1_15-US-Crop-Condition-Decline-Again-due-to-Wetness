U.S. Crop Conditions Decline again due to Wetness
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. corn crop declined 3% last week to 68% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the corn condition had improved last week and 9 states indicated that the corn condition had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the western Corn Belt and the mid-South while most of the declines were found in the central and eastern Corn Belt.  The five states with the highest corn are: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kentucky, and Tennessee.  The five states with the lowest rated corn are: Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, North Carolina, and Kansas.

	The condition of the corn crop is now equal to the long term average and significantly below that of last year.  The cause of the declining conditions continues to be the persistent heavy rains that fell across the central and eastern Corn Belt resulting in yellowish corn that is developing slowly and unevenly.  The saturated conditions are resulting in a loss of nitrogen which will limit the yield potential in the saturated areas as well as potentially in other areas of the field as well.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. corn crop declined 2% last week to 63% rated good to excellent.  Six states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week and 10 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the western Corn Belt and the Delta while most of the declines were found in the central and eastern Corn Belt.  The five states with the highest rated soybeans are: Wisconsin, Mississippi, Iowa, Kentucky, and Minnesota.  The five states with the lowest rated soybeans are: Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Kansas.

<p>
	The declining condition of the soybean crop now puts the crop below the long term average.  In the saturated areas, the soybeans are very small, poor in color, very delayed in development, and losing yield potential.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's topsoil moisture held steady last week with 8 states indicating that the soil in their state got wetter and 10 states indicating that the soil in their state got dryer last week.  Most of the wetter conditions were found in the central and eastern Corn Belt while most of the dryer conditions were found in the western Corn Belt.  The five states with the wettest soils are: Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Missouri, and Michigan.  The five states with the driest soils are: North Carolina, Mississippi. Tennessee, South Dakota, and Arkansas.
</p>
<p>
	This is the time of the year when the soils generally start to dry out due to the summer heat, but just the opposite has been happening this year with continued heavy rains across the same areas.  The wettest areas are generally along a line from about Des Moines, Iowa eastward to Columbus, Ohio.
