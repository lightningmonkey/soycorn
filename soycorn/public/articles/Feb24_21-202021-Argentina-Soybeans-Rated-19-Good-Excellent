2020/21 Argentina Soybeans Rated 19% Good/Excellent
<p>
	The rainfall in January was beneficial for the soybeans in Argentina, but it looks like February is going to end up as one of the driest in the last 30 years.  Cool weather during the first half of February saved the crop from significant moisture stress.  There is not much rainfall in the forecast for this week and temperatures are expected to be above normal, but not extreme.

<p>
	This is a critical time for the soybeans in Argentina as the crop starts to fill pods, so the production estimate was left unchanged this week while we wait to see how the weather plays out. The soil moisture is the highest in the core production areas while the southern provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa need rain to avoid moisture stress.

<p>
The early planted soybeans were 62% setting pods and 15% filling pods late last week. The later planted soybeans were 55% flowering and 5% setting pods late last week.  The most advanced soybean development is in the core production areas where the soybeans are about 35% filling pods, but that is still about 20% behind average.

<p>
The soybeans were rated 11% poor to very poor, 70% fair, and 19% good/excellent late last week.  The good/excellent compares to 23% last week and 66% last year.  The soil moisture for the soybeans was rated 21% short to very short and 79% favorable to optimum.  The favorable to optimum compares to 85% last week and 97% last year.
