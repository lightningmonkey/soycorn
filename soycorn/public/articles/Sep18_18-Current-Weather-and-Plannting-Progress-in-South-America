Current Weather and Planting Progress in South America
<p>
In central Brazil there have been some scattered showers in western and northern Mato Grosso.  The showers have been much more beneficial a little further south in Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias, Minas Gerais and all across for southern Brazil.

<p>
<b>Brazil Soybeans</b> - The Department of Rural Economics for the state of Parana (Deral), has indicated that the soybean planting is off to the quickest start in the last five years.  The soil moisture was favorable for germination and stand establishment as soon as they were allowed to start planting earlier last week.  Deral indicated that 1% of the soybeans had been planted by the end of last Monday.

It might even be a little too wet in some areas of Parana, but no one is complaining.  In September 2017, the first rain did not occur until September 28th, which put the entire crop behind schedule.

	Farmers in Mato Grosso were allowed to start planting their soybeans this past Sunday and generally the first farmers to plant are those who intend to plant a second crop of cotton following the soybean harvest.  Soybean planting is off to a limited start in Mato Grosso, but it is off to a good start south-central and southern Brazil.

	<b>Brazil Corn</b> - The planting of the full-season corn is well underway in Parana and Rio Grande do Sul.  Now that it has rained in the state of Minas Gerais, farmers there should also now be starting to plant their full-season corn.
</p>
<p>
<b>Argentina Corn</b> - Farmers in Argentina have started their early corn planting in the northern and eastern parts of the country.  The corn is planted in two phases with the early planting ending about the end of October.  Farmers then start planting their later corn at the end of November and early December and that planting is completed about mid-January.

	The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange is estimating that farmers in Argentina will increase their corn acreage by 400,000 hectares from 5.4 million to 5.8 million hectares.
