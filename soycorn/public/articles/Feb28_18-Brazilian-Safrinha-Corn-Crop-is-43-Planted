Brazilian Safrinha Corn Crop is 43% Planted
<p>
The full-season corn harvest in Brazil is 19% complete, which is about equal to last year, but behind the average.  In the state of Rio Grande do Sul, the full-season corn is more than half harvested and the yields continue to be variable.  The full-season corn in Parana is 6% harvested and the harvest has not yet started in the state of Minas Gerais.

	The safrinha corn is 43% planted compared to 57% last year and 47% for the 5-year average according to AgRural.  The safrinha corn planting in Mato Grosso is progressing OK, but it remains slow in Parana and the other states.

	In Mato Grosso the safrinha corn is 68% planted compared to 78% last year and 58% for the 5-year average.  Last week was a good week for planting in Mato Grosso with 22% of the crop planted in one week.  The most advanced is the mid-north region with 84.8% planted and the slowest is the northeastern region with 43% planted. In Sorriso, Mato Grosso, corn prices last week were in the range of R$ 16.00 to R$ 17.00 per sack ($2.27 to $2.41 per bushel) and farmers contend they need R$ 18.00 per sack to break even ($2.55 per bushel).

	In the state of Parana, the safrinha corn is 42% planted and the planting pace should accelerate now that dryer weather will allow for more soybeans to be harvested.  The dryer weather can't come soon enough because the ideal planting window for safrinha corn has already passed in most of the state.
