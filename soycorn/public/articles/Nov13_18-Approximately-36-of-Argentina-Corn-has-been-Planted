Approximately 36% of Argentina's Corn has been Planted
<p>
	There were heavy rains across central Argentina over the last three days with some areas receiving up to 10 inches and it is still raining in some areas.   There will probably be some localized flooding and some of the early planted corn may need to be replanted.  Outside of the areas of heavy rainfall, the weather in Argentina has improved over the last two weeks and the forecast looks beneficial as well.

	Farmers in Argentina have planted 35.9% of their 2018/19 corn crop, which is an advance of only 0.4% for the week.  The most advanced planting is in the northern core and southern core regions where 85-90% of the corn has been planted.  In southern Argentina the corn is approximately 35-50% planted and no corn has been planted in far northern Argentina.

	The early planted corn is in vegetative development with a few fields approaching pollination.  The condition of the early corn improved a little last week and it is rated 1.3% very poor, 13.7% poor, 48.4% fair, 31.9% good, and 4.8% very good.  The soil moisture of the early corn is rated 0.7% very short, 19.9% short, 59.7% favorable, 17.1% optimum, and 2.6% surplus.  The soil moisture improved last week and it should improve some more next week.

	A small advance in corn planting in Argentina is typical for this time of the year.  Farmers do not like to plant their corn during November because the corn would then be pollinating during January, which can be the hottest and driest time of the year.  It looks like only about 45% of Argentina's corn crop will be planted during the first phase of planting and about 55% will be planted during the second phase which starts in late November and early December.
