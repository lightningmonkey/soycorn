Condition of the 2019 U.S. Soybean Crop Unchanged
<p>
	There were some light scattered showers over the weekend, but the heaviest amounts were generally in the western and northwestern Corn Belt with lighter amounts in the eastern Corn Belt.  Some of the dryer states are in the central and eastern Corn Belt, which is also the area where the soybean development has been the most delayed.

The condition of the U.S. soybean crop was unchanged last week at 54% rated good to excellent.  The 2019 U.S. soybeans are 57% flowering compared to 85% last year and 79% for the 5-year average.  The U.S. soybeans are 21% setting pods compared to 58% last year and 45% for the 5-year average.

<p>
The soybean flowering in Indiana is 42% behind the average (37% vs. 79%), its 35% behind in Ohio (41% vs. 76%), its 35% behind in Michigan (42% vs. 76%), its 31% behind in Illinois (52% vs. 83%), and its 19% behind in Iowa (65% vs. 84%).

I hate to sound like a broken record, but my biggest concern is for the latest planted soybeans that are essentially double crop soybeans this year.  The development of these late planted soybeans will continue to be slow as long as this dryer pattern persists.
