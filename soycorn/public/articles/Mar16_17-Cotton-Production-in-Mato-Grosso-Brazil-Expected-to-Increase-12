Cotton Production in Mato Grosso, Brazil Expected to Increase 12%
<p>
	In their second evaluation of the 2016/17 cotton crop in Mato Grosso, the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) increased the cotton acreage in the state from 600,000 hectares in their last report to 617,200 hectares in their current report.

	In recent years, the trend in the state has been for more of the cotton to be planted as a second crop after soybeans and that trend is continuing in 2016/17.  Imea is reporting that farmers in the state planted 83,400 hectares of full-season cotton (13.5% of the total) and 533,800 hectares of safrinha cotton (86.4% of the total).  The full-season cotton in the state is generally planted during December, whereas the safrinha cotton is generally planted during January.

	Farmers wishing to plant a second crop of cotton try to plant early maturing soybeans as early as possible after the soybean-free period in the state expires on September 15th.  These soybeans are then harvested in January allowing for the cotton to be planted before the ideal planting window closes at the end of January.

Imea is expecting the state to produce 986,600 tons of cotton fiber, which is 12.5% more than 2015/16.  Mato Grosso is the largest cotton producing state in Brazil with the production concentrated in the western and southeastern regions of the state.
