2018/19 Brazil Safrinha Corn Planting off to a Record Fast Start
<p>
In Rio Grande do Sul, the full-season corn is 23% harvested and farmers are reporting very good yields both for irrigated and non-irrigated corn.  Some irrigated corn yields have been reported as high as 14,800 kg/ha (227 bu/ac). The full-season corn in Parana is 5% harvested and the crop is rated 1% poor, 21% average, and 78% good.

I am currently estimating the 2018/19 Brazilian full-season corn crop at 23.5 million tons and the safrinha corn crop at 68.0 million tons for a total corn crop of 91.5 million tons.

	The 2018/19 safrinha corn crop is being planted at a record fast pace.  AgRural reported that 24% of the safrinha corn had been planted by last Thursday compared to 11% for last year and the 5-year average.

In Mato Grosso the safrinha corn is 30% planted compared to 16% last year and 15% for the 5-year average according to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea).  This represents an advance of 14% for the week.  The fastest safrinha corn planting is in the mid-north where 36% of the corn has been planted.  The early safrinha corn planting continues at a record fast pace, which is good for corn if there is normal rainfall during the second half of the summer rainy season.

Imea estimates that farmers in the state will increase their safrinha corn acreage by 1.6% this year to 4.69 million hectares (11.5 million acres).  They estimate that the statewide corn yield in 2018/19 will be 102.2 sacks per hectare (94.4 bu/ac).

The Department of Rural Economics in the state of Parana (Deral) estimates that 30% of the safrinha corn in Parana has been planted.

The president of the cooperative Comigo in southwestern Goias indicated that their membership will increase their safrinha corn acreage by 5%.  The 7,700 member of Comigo plant about half of the safrinha corn in Goias.  In an interview with Reuters, he stated that their members have given up planting safrinha corn in March because of the high risk of dry weather during critical reproduction periods.
