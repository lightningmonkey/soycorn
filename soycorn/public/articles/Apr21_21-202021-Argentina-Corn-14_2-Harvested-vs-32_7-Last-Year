2020/21 Argentina Corn 14.2% Harvested vs. 32.7% Last Year
<p>
	The corn in Argentina was 14.2% harvested late last week compared to 32.7% last year and 25.4% average.  This represents an advance of 2.2% for the week. In the core production area, the corn was 40-50% harvested with 5-10% harvested in southern Argentina and 0% harvested in far northern Argentina.  The rains of recent weeks has led to a relatively slow corn harvest due to nigh grain moisture and wet field conditions.

<p>
	The average corn yield thus far is 8,110 kg/ha (128.9 bu/ac), which is up 2.2 bu/ac from the prior week.  The best yields are being reported from the core production areas, but there continues to be a very wide range in yields from 5,500 to 9,100 kg/ha (88.2 to 144.8 bu/ac).

Improved rains, which started in March, are expected to help the late planted corn, which is 19% approaching maturity.  The earlier planted corn has already advanced to 66% mature.
