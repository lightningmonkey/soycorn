2019 U.S. Crop Conditions improve 1-2% Good to Excellent
<p>
<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2019 U.S. corn crop improved 1% to 57% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the corn condition improved last week while 10 states indicated that the corn condition declined last week and 1 state was unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the central Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the southern and northern areas.  The top five rated corn states are: Colorado, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, and North Dakota.  The five lowest rated corn states are: North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, and Michigan.

	The recent rainfall has benefited the corn, but the cool temperatures are slowing down the development of the crop.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2019 U.S. soybean crop improved 2% last week to 55% rated good to excellent.  Nine states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week while 7 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week and 2 states were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the central Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the southern and northern areas.  The top five rated soybean states are: Tennessee, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Louisiana, and a tie between South Dakota, Mississippi, and Iowa.  The five lowest rated soybean states are: Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Missouri, and Illinois.

	The weather has benefited the soybeans as well, but I am concerned about the cool temperatures slowing down the soybean development, which in turn increases the risk for potential frost damage.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture improved last week with 13 states indicating improved moisture and 5 states indicating declining soil moisture.  Most of the improvements were found across the Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the northern Corn Belt.  The five states with the best soil moisture are: Kansas, South Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska, and Louisiana.  The five states with the driest soil moisture are:  Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, and Arkansas.

	The soil moisture bottomed out in mid-August and it has since been slowly improving.  This marks 19 years that I have been tracking the soil moisture in the main production states and the pattern has been very consistent.  On average, the soil moisture reaches its driest point about the third week of August and then it starts to slowly improve.
