Farms in Brazil Want Deadline for Soy Planting Extended 30 Days
<p>
	Hot and dry weather across central Brazil is delaying the completion of the 2015/16 soybean planting as well as forcing some farmers to replant their soybeans.  As a result, various farm organizations in the states of Mato Grosso and Goias are petitioning the state government to grant an extension of 30 days concerning the last day when farmers are permitted to plant soybeans.

<p>
New rules took effect in the state of Mato Grosso this growing season requiring that soybeans may only be planted starting September 15th and ending December 31st.  The new rules also specifically prohibited the planting of a second crop of soybeans after the first crop was harvested.  This limit as to when soybeans could be planted was put in place to reduce the chances of soybean rust extending from one growing season to the next.

The problem this year is that some of the soybeans have not yet been planted due to the dry conditions in addition to the fact that some soybeans may also have to be replanted.  Some municipalities in Mato Grosso have already declared a state of emergency and they are asking the state government to recognize that this is an emergency and to grant the 30 day extension until January 31st in order to allow farmers to complete their soybean planting.

Farmers in northern Goias are facing similar hot and dry conditions.  The Agricultural and Livestock Federation of Goias (Faeg) estimated that only 50% of the intended soybeans in the northern half of the state have been planted.  The problem of dry weather this year extends into northeastern Brazil as well.  Some farmers in northeastern Brazil have been trying to plant their soybeans since October, but the lack of rainfall has kept them out of the field for most of the time.

There is also a concern by farmers who have purchased crop insurance which specifies a certain date by when the soybeans must be planted in order to still be eligible for insurance coverage.  The farm organizations are petitioning the state governments to extend the deadline for soybean planting in order to maintain insurance coverage.
