Brazilian soybean exports declined 10 million tons in 2019 due to reduced production in 2018/19, but the decline in soybean exports was compensated for by increased exports of corn, meat, and cotton.

The value of Brazil's meat exports in 2019 increased by 12.5% to US$ 6.5 billion compared to US$ 14.6 billion in 2018.  The African swine fever outbreak in China and other countries helped to propel the increase in meat exports.
