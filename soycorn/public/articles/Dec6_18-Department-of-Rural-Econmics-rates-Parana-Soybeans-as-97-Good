Department of Rural Economics rates Parana Soybeans as 97% Good
<p>
In their latest weekly report released on Tuesday, the Department of Rural Economics for the state of Parana (Deral), indicted that the soybean planting in the state is now complete.  Soybean planting started off very fast in Brazil's second largest soybean producing state, but wet weather slowed down the second half of the planting.  Farmers in the state started planting as soon as the soybean-free period ended on September 10th.

Farmers in other states such as Mato Grosso, Goias, and Sao Paulo continued to plant the soybeans at a record fast pace all the way until the end of planting.  The soybean crop as a whole in Brazil is 93% planted with only a few areas of far southern Brazil and northeastern Brazil remaining to be planted.

In addition to being planted earlier than last year, the soybean crop in Parana is also rated better than last year.  Deral is now rating the soybean crop in Parana as 97% good compared to 90% good last year at this time.  The current soybean crop is 11% filling pods compared to 3% last year.  The initial harvest will start earlier than last year with some of the earliest soybeans being harvested during the second half of December.

	Deral is estimating the 2018/19 soybean acreage at 5.45 million hectares (13.4 million acres), which is essentially unchanged compared to last year.  The 2018/19 statewide soybean yield is estimated at 3,600 kg/ha (53.2 bu/ac), which would be 2% higher than last year.  As a result, the state's soybean production is also predicted to be 2% greater at 19.6 million tons.

	Even though the crop is in very good condition, farmers are worried that it may cost more to control soybean rust this year.  The first confirmed cases of soybean rust occurred record early this growing season.  Embrapa reports that there have already been more than 30 confirmed cases of soybean rust in the state, which is by far the most of any Brazilian state.  Scientists are advising farmers in the state to be prepared to apply fungicides as soon as the first symptoms appear in their fields.
