Safrinha Corn in Excellent condition in central Mato Grosso
<p>
AgRural reported that the full-season corn in Brazil was 51% harvested in the middle of last week compared to 63% last year and 59% for the five year average.

It is the safrinha crop that will determine Brazil's corn production in 2017/18 and the safrinha corn crop is now completely planted.  The safrinha corn crop is rated in good condition except for the state of Minas Gerais where the rains have been irregular.

The most advanced safrinha corn is in the state of Mato Grosso where the earliest corn has already pollinated and is starting to fill grain.  The latest planted corn is 1-2 feet tall and growing rapidly in the hot and humid weather.  The soil moisture is generally good across Mato Grosso and it should remain good at least for the near term.  There continues to be a lot of rain in Mato Grosso and the safrinha corn is generally rated in good to excellent condition.

The safrinha corn in Parana is the most delayed, but the state did receive rain over the weekend.  The forecast is calling for dryer weather to move into the state this week.  There is always a chance of frost in Parana and southern Mato Grosso do Sul by the end of May, so the safrinha corn in southern Brazil has a long way to go.
