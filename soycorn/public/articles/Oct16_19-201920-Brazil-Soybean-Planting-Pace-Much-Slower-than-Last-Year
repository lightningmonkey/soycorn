2019/20 Brazil Soybean Planting Pace much Slower than Last Year
<p>
	The weather in Brazil continues to be uneven with better rainfall in southern Brazil and scattered rainfall in central Brazil.  Nationwide, the 2019/20 Brazilian soybeans are 11% planted compared to 20% last year and 12% average according to AgRural.  The slow start is the result of dryer than normal conditions thus far this planting season.  The forecast for this week is calling for above normal rainfall in southern Brazil and below normal rainfall in much of central Brazil.

	Delayed soybean planting in central Brazil does not necessarily mean lower soybean yields as long as the weather during the remainder of the growing season is beneficial.  Delayed soybean planting does mean a longer time to control soybean rust and a delay in planting the safrinha corn.

	<b>Mato Grosso</b> - According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), farmers in Mato Grosso had planted 16% of their soybeans as of last Friday compared to 27% last year and 19% average.  The most advanced planting is in the western part of the state where 29% have been planted.  The slowest planting pace is in the northeastern part of the state where 5% of the soybeans have been planted.  The usual pattern is for the rains to start earlier in the western region of the state and later in the eastern region of the state.
