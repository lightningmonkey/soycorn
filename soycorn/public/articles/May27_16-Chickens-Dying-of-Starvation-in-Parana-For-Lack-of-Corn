Chickens Dying of Starvation in Parana for lack of Corn
<p>
The lack of corn in southern Brazil has gotten so dire that there are reports of chickens dying of starvation because no corn is available at any price.  In a disturbing report out of Cascavel in western Parana, a local poultry producer is reporting that he lost 35,000 birds to starvation because his feed supplier could not purchase corn.

The feed supplier had warned producers that he was rationing supply in an effort to supply a minimal amount of feed to his clients, but even rationing did not work.  His birds were 35 days old and the two houses generally consumed 9 tons of feed per day, but they went for over a week without any feed before the chickens started dying.

He estimates his losses at R$ 38,000 and it is unclear if he will ever be able to recoup his loses because this has never happened before and there is no one to ask for help.  Unfortunately, he is not alone, other poultry producers have had the same problem with the same results.

Corn is being imported from Paraguay and Argentina and the Brazilian government has sold some of its corn stocks, but in some locations there is no corn to purchase regardless of the price.  Other feed manufactures are rationing their dwindling corn supplies in an effort to supply a minimal amount of feed for their customers.  Everyone is hoping the situation will start improving once the safrinha corn harvest starts in early to mid-June.
