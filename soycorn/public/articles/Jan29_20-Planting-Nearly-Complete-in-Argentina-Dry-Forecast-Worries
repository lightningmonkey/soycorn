The attach&eacute;'s corn acreage is 100,000 hectares lower than the USDA and their yield estimate is 2.4% lower than the USDA.  They feel the change in political power in Argentina convinced farmers to reduce their corn acreage by 200-400,000 hectares and to plant more soybeans instead.  They indicated that industry estimates the 2019/20 corn acreage in Argentina at close to 6.0 million hectares.
