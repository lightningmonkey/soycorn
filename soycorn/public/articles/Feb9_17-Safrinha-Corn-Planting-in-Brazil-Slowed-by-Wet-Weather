Safrinha Corn Planting in Brazil Slowed by Wet Weather
<p>
	Brazilian farmers continue to struggle with wet weather that has slowed down the soybean harvest.  This in turn, has slowed down the planting of the safrinha corn crop as well.
</p>
<p>
	AgRural is estimating that 14% of the safrinha corn in Brazil has been planted, which is about equal to last year, but much slower than what had been anticipated several months ago.  The 2016/17 Brazilian soybean crop was planted very early in Mato Grosso last September and as a result, it was anticipated that the safrinha corn would be planted early as well
</p>

Mato Grosso is the largest safrinha corn producing state in Brazil and the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) estimates that 27% of the safrinha corn has been planted.  This represents an advance of 16% over the past week.  It had been anticipated that at least 40% of the crop would be planted by now.  Last year at this time, 11% of the safrinha corn had been planted.  The central part of the state is most advanced at 45% of the corn planted.

Imea is estimating that farmers in the state will plant 4.42 million hectares of safrinha corn, which would represent an increase of 16% over last year.

Parana is the second leading safrinha corn producing state in Brazil and the Department of Rural Economics (Deral) estimates that farmers in the state have planted 10% of their safrinha corn compared to 6% last week.  This is well behind last year's pace when 47% of the corn had been planted by February 11th.

The delay in getting the corn planted means that a higher percentage of the crop will be planted in a shorter period of time.  This could be important later when a larger percentage of the crop is pollinating at the same time as well.   Deral is estimating that farmers in the state will plant 2.3 million hectares of safrinha corn which is up 4% from the 2.2 million planted last year.
</p>
<p>
The safrinha corn planting is slow because the soybean harvest is slow.  Deral is reporting that 6% of the soybeans have been harvested.  This is up from the 2% that was harvested last week, but well behind the 30% that was harvested by February 11th last year.
