Brazil Increases its Wheat Imports from the United States
<p>
	Millers in Brazil continue to import wheat from the United States and Canada while they wait for the wheat harvest in southern Brazil to get underway.  During August, Brazil imported 103,400 tons of U.S. wheat and 18,500 tons of Canadian wheat.  As far as the U.S. is concerned, this represents a 60% increase over the 69,800 tons of U.S. wheat imported in August of 2015.  Brazil is expected to import more U.S. wheat in September, maybe as much as 200,000 tons.

The Department of Rural Economics in Parana (Deral) is reporting that the wheat crop in Parana is 7% in vegetative development, 11% flowering, 28% filling grain, 32% mature, and 22% harvested.  The early reports indicate that the grain quality is very good this year.
