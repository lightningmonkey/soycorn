	The weather over the past week was quite benign with cooler temperatures and occasional showers moving across the Midwest so it did not come as a surprise that the corn condition only declined slightly.

The one main production state that seemed to miss out on the rainfall last week and over the weekend was Iowa.  The cooler temperatures were beneficial and they helped to hold down the crop stress, but the state got dryer last week with 56% of the state's soil moisture now rated short to very short.
