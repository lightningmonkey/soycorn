2019/20 Brazil Soybean Planting off to a Slow Start, 1% Planted
<p>
<b>Brazilian Soybeans</b> - The rainfall in Brazil continues to be widely scattered with variable amounts.  If a farmer is lucky, they may have received a downpour of 1-2 inches.  Most farmers were not that lucky and they received lessor amounts or no rain at all.
</p>
<p>
	The early soybean planting is just getting underway in parts of Brazil.  Brazilian farmers were allowed to start planting their 2019/20 soybean crop several weeks ago, but dry conditions have kept most planters out of the field.
</p>
<p>
<b>Brazil soybean planting</b> - Nationwide, the 2019/20 soybean planting is 1% complete compared to 4.6% last year 2.3% average.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mato Grosso</b> - Farmers in Mato Grosso have planted 1.6% of their 2019/20 soybeans compared to 4.3% last year at this time according to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea).  The most advanced planting is in the mid-north region where 2.5% of the soybeans have been planted.  The slowest planting pace is in the northeastern part of the state where 0.2% has been planted.
</p>
<p>
<b>Parana</b> - Farmers in Parana had planted 3% of their intended soybeans as of earlier last week according to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral).  It has been an irregular start to planting in Parana with some farmers receiving enough rainfall to start planting, while others have yet to receive their first rain.
</p>
<p>
The same irregularity in planting is the case in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo, Goias, and Minas Gerais.  The better rains have fallen in far southern Brazil and northern Brazil.
</p>
<p>
<b>Brazilian Corn</b> - The weather for full-season corn planting has been better than for soybeans because nearly all of the full-season corn is planted in southern and southeastern Brazil.  Southern Brazil has received some showers and the forecast is calling for more rain over the next 1-2 weeks.
</p>
<p>
Brazilian farmers have started to plant their full-season corn in southern Brazil.  The two states with the largest full-season corn acreage are Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul.  Corn planting in Minas Gerais has been slow getting started due to dry conditions.  The soil moisture is better in Rio Grande do Sul and farmers are actively planting their full-season corn.
</p>
<p>
In Parana, Deral reported that 39% of the corn had been planted earlier last week and that the crop was rated 7% average and 93% good.
