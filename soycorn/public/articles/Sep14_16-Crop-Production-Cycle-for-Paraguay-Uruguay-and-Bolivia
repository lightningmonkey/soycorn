Crop Production Cycle for Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia
<p>
	<b>Paraguay</b> - I do not publish a month-by-month production cycle for Paraguay because it is very similar to the state of Parana in southern Brazil.  The main soybean production region of Paraguay is along the eastern side of the country right across the Parana River from western Parana.  The weather, soils, and cropping practices in Paraguay are very similar to that of western Parana.
In fact, the vast majority of soybean farmers in Paraguay are Brazilians who moved across the border starting in the 1970's in search of cheap land.

<b>Uruguay</b> - The soybeans in Uruguay are grown in two locations.  One area is along the western side of the country across the Uruguay River from Argentina and the cropping pattern there is very similar to that of eastern Argentina.  The other area of soybean production is in the northern part of the country along the border with the state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil and the cropping pattern there is similar to southern Brazil.

<b>Bolivia</b> - The soybean production in Bolivia is in the eastern part of the country which borders on the state of Mato Grosso, so the cropping pattern there is similar to that of western Mato Grosso.
