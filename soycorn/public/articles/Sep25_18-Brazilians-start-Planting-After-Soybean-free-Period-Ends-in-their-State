Brazilians start planting after Soybean-free period ends in their State
<p>
As the soybean planting gets started in Brazil, there is always some confusion outside of Brazil as to when farmers can start planting their soybeans.  In Brazil, you are not allowed to start planting soybeans until the soybean-free period has ended.  The soybean-free period is a period of at least 90 days during which no live soybean plants are permitted as a way to slow the spread of soybean rust from one growing season to the next.

If a farmer is caught planting before the allowed date, they could face hefty fines, be required to destroy the crop, and not be eligible for government programs.  As a result, no one in Brazil will risk planting their soybeans earlier than what is allowed.  Below is a list of the major soybean producing states in Brazil and when the soybean-free period ends.

<table>

<tr><td>Soybean-free periods end September 10th  </td><td> Parana </td></tr>
<tr><td>Soybean-free period end September 15th   </td><td> 	Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina </td></tr>
<tr><td>Soybean-free period end September 30th	</td><td> Goias, Minas Gerais, Tocantins, Maranhao </td></tr>
<tr><td>Soybean-free period ends October 10th </td><td>	Bahia </td></tr>
<tr><td>Soybean-free period end October 15th </td><td>	Piaui </td></tr>

	Brazilian farmers will not rush out to the field and start planting their soybeans just because the soybean-free period has ended.  Farmers generally wait to start planting until they have adequate soil moisture to insure germination and stand establishment.  Since the soil moisture is so short after the prolonged dry season, farmers generally wait to plant until they have received 2-3 inches of rainfall.
