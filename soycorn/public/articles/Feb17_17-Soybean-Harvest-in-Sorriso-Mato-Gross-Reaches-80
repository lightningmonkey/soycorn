Soybean Harvest in Sorriso, Mato Grosso Reaches 80%
<p>
	The municipality of Sorriso in central Mato Grosso is the largest soybean producing municipality in Brazil and farmers in the municipality have harvested approximately 80% of their 2016/17 soybean crop according to the president of the local Rural Syndicate.  Farmers have managed to harvest between showers, but recent heavy rains have slowed the end of the harvest.  Farmers in the region are concerned that the seed quality of the last 20% of the crop could be impacted by continued wet weather.

Farmers in the municipality plant approximately 630,000 hectares of soybeans.  This is also a major area for safrinha crop production as well.  The president of the Rural Syndicate expects farmers in the municipality to plant 450,000 hectares of safrinha corn, 20-40,000 hectares of safrinha cotton, and 25,000 hectares of safrinha dry beans.  Farmers in the region plant their safrinha cotton first because the ideal planting window for safrinha cotton generally closes by the end of January.  The ideal planting window for safrinha corn generally closes about February 20th.
