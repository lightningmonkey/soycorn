47% of Soybeans in Mato Grosso followed by Safrinha Corn
<p>
	One of the more significant developments in Brazilian agriculture over the past decade has been the tremendous increase in safrinha corn production.  According to Conab's most recent report, the 2016/17 safrinha corn crop is estimated at 61.6 million tons, which if verified, would represent 67.3% of Brazil's total corn production.

<p>
	The leading safrinha corn producing state in Brazil is Mato Grosso and farmers in the state are projected to produce 24.1 million tons of safrinha corn in 2016/17 which would be 39% of all the safrinha corn produced in Brazil.  The corn is rated in good condition, which is much better than last year when hot and dry weather severely impacted the crop.  The corn is still developing in the state and if the projection is accurate, the 2016/17 crop will be 60% larger than the crop produced in 2015/16.

	Farmers in the state started to plant their soybeans as soon as the soybean-free period ended last September 15th.  This allowed for a relatively early harvest and therefore early planting of the safrinha corn as soon as the soybeans were harvested.  In Mato Grosso this year, 47% of the soybean acreage will be followed by a second crop of corn.  In 2015/16, 40% of the soybeans were followed by a second crop of corn.  The highest percentage before this year was in 2013 when 41% of the soybeans were followed by safrinha corn.

<p>
Conab is estimating that farmers in the state will produce 24.1 million tons of safrinha corn which is 60% more than the 15.0 million tons produced in 20165.  If the weather cooperates for the next two months, it will be a record large safrinha corn crop for the state, surpassing the previous record of 21.8 million set in 2014/15.
