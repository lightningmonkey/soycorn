U.S. Corn Condition holds Steady, Soybeans Decline Slightly
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. corn crop held steady last week at 75% rated good to excellent.  Six states indicated that the corn condition had improved last week, 9 states indicated that the corn condition had declined last week and 3 states were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the western and northern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the central and eastern Corn Belt.  The five states with the highest rated corn are: Wisconsin, Colorado, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Tennessee.  The five states with the lowest rated corn are: Missouri, Michigan, Kansas, Ohio, and Indiana.

	The corn crop continues to be rated better than last year and the long term average.  I was mildly surprised that the condition held steady last week instead of declining a point or two.  There is moisture stress being reported across the southern Corn Belt and the eastern Corn Belt due to the high temperatures and drying soils.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. soybean crop declined 1% last week to 73% rated good to excellent.  Five states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week, 11 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week and two states were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the northern Corn Belt and the Delta while most of the declines were found in the central and eastern Corn Belt.  The five states with the highest rated soybeans are: Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Tennessee.  The five states with the lowest rated soybeans are: Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Michigan, and Ohio.

	The soybean crop continues to be rated better than last year and the long term average, but the rating did slip a little, which could continue in the weeks ahead.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The generally hot and dry conditions last week resulted in dryer soils across the U.S. with only two states Minnesota and North Dakota indicating that the soils got wetter last week and 16 states indicating that the soils got dryer last week.  The five states with the wettest soils are:  Minnesota, Wisconsin, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Kentucky.  The five states with the driest soils are: Missouri, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, and Arkansas.

	Sixteen of the eighteen states were dryer last week and the soil moisture is now significantly dryer than last year and the long term average.  The driest soils are basically along a line from Kansas City eastward to Ohio, sort of along Interstate I-70.  I am concerned about the high temperatures and the drying soils.  We could be setting the stage for problems down the road if this weather pattern continues.
