2019/20 Brazil Soybeans 21% Planted vs. 34% in 2018/19
<p>
The 2019/20 soybean planting is Brazil is 21% complete compared to 34% last year and the planting is on pace with the 5-year average according to AgRural.  This represents an advance of 10% during last week.  The soybean planted percentage was propelled higher last week mainly by the state of Mato Grosso where 41% of the soybeans have been planted compared to 19% a week earlier.

	Dry weather has delayed the soybean planting in south-central Brazil in states such as Parana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo, Goias, and Minas Gerais.  Some of the soybeans in these states will have to be replanted due to poor germination.  A delay in soybean planting in Brazil doesn't necessarily mean lower soybean yields, but it does increase the risk of lower yields if there is adverse weather later in the growing season.

	The rainfall last week in central Brazil continued to be scattered and uneven.  Some areas of east-central Brazil now have the slowest start to the summer rainy season in several decades.  The rainfall last week in southern Brazil was better, especially in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
</p>
 <p>
	Rainfall is most needed in the states of Parana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo, Goias, and Minas Gerais (more on that later).  The forecast for this week is calling for improved chances of rainfall in the areas that need it the most.

	<b>Mato Grosso</b> - According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), the farmers in Mato Grosso had planted 41% of their intended 2019/20 soybeans by late last week compared to 51% last year and 29% average.  This represents an increase of 23% for the week, which is a tremendous increase in just one week.
</p>
 <p>
The most advanced planting is in the western region of the state where 55% of the soybeans have been planted.  The slowest planting pace continues to be northeastern Mato Grosso where 24% of the soybeans have been planted.
</p>
 <p>
<b>Parana</b> - Farmers in Parana had planted 33% of their soybeans by earlier last week according to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral).  Dry weather in western and northern Parana resulted in poor germination of some of the earliest planted soybeans resulting in some of the soybeans needing to be replanted.  The soybeans in Parana are rated 1% poor, 37% average, and 62% good.
</p>
 <p>
<b>Rio Grande do Sul</b> - Emater/RS (the extension service) reported that farmers in the state are just getting started on their soybean planting.  Soybean planting in the state is allowed from September 11th to December 31st.  Emater is estimating that farmers in the state will increase their soybean acreage 1.9% to 5.95 million hectares and the soybean yield in 2019/20 will be 3,315 kg/ha (49.0 bu/ac).
</p>
 <p>
Soybean planting in Rio Grande do Sul generally accelerates during the second half of October with the first week of November being the largest soybean planting week in the state.   One of the reasons why soybean planting in Rio Grande do Sul is slower than in neighboring Parana is because much of the soybean the state are planted as a second crop after the harvest of the winter wheat.  Farmers in Rio Grande do Sul have harvested 7% of their winter wheat and the vast majority of the winter wheat will be followed by soybeans.

 <p>
In the states of Mato Grosso do Sul and Goias, the soybeans are approximately 20% planted.  In the states of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, the soybeans are approximately 10% planted.
