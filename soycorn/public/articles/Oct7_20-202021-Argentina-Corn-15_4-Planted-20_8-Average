2020/21 Argentina Corn 15.4% Planted, 20.8% Average
<p>
The 2020/21 Argentina corn estimate was left unchanged this week at 50.0 million tons and I have a neutral bias going forward.  The start of the corn planting in Argentina is slower than average and the forecast for dry weather this week will continue to slow the planting pace.  The corn acreage in Argentina is still a matter of debate with many analysts believing that the eventual acreage will end up below current estimates.

The weather in Argentina has also been irregular.  There have been some rains in the southern and eastern areas of the country, but it has remained mostly hot and dry in the western and norther areas.  The forecast for this week is basically dry, so soil moisture levels will decline this week.

Argentina corn was 15.4% planted late last week compared to 21% last year and 20.8% average.  The corn is rated 4% poor, 53% fair, and 43% good to Excellent.  The soil moisture for the corn is rated 14% short to very short and 86% favorable.  The early phase of corn planting is 30.7% completed compared to 40.4% average.
