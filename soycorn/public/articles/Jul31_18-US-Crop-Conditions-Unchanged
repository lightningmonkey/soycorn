U.S. Crop Conditions Unchanged
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the U.S. corn crop remained unchanged last week at 72% rated good to excellent.  Nine states indicated that the corn condition had improved last week, 8 states indicated that the condition had declined last week, and 1 state was unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the northern and western Corn Belt, while most of the declines were found in the central and eastern Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn stares are:  North Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.  The five lowest rated corn states are:  North Carolina, Missouri, Texas, Kansas, and Michigan.

	Even though the overall good to excellent remained unchanged, the crop condition declined slightly in my ranking due to changes within the states.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the U.S. soybean crop remained unchanged last week at 70% rated good to excellent.  Six states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week and 12 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the western Corn Belt, while most of the declines were found scattered across the Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are:  Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, and a three-way tie between North Dakota, Minnesota, and Illinois.   The five lowest rated soybean states are:  Missouri, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Louisiana.

	There was a one point slippage from the excellent to the good category, which resulted in a slight overall decline in the soybean rating.

		<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture declined last week with 5 states indicating that the soil moisture improved, 12 states indicating that the soil moisture declined last week, and 1 state was unchanged.  The improvements were found in the southern Corn Belt while the declines were found throughout the Corn Belt.  The five states with the best soil moisture are:  Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.  The five states with the driest soils are:  Missouri, Arkansas, Michigan, Louisiana, and Mississippi.

	As expected, the soil moisture declined last week and I expect it to decline again this week.  The cooler than normal temperatures during the second half of July have helped to conserve some of the soil moisture, but the forecast is calling for hotter temperatures over the next two weeks, so the soil moisture will probably continue to decline for the next two weeks.
