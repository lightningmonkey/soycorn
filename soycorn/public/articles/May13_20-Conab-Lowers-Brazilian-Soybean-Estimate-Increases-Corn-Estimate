Conab Lowers Brazilian Soybean Estimate, Increases Corn Estimate
<p>
	In their May Crop Report released on Tuesday, May 12th, Conab lowered their estimate of the 2019/20 Brazilian soybean crop while they increased their estimate of the 2019/20 Brazilian corn crop.
</p>
<p>
	The 2019/20 Brazilian soybean estimate was lowered 1.74 million tons from their April estimate to 120.32 million tons.  If verified, the Brazilian soybean crop would be 4.6% larger than last year's crop of 115.0 million tons.  The 2019/20 Brazilian soybean acreage was left unchanged from last month at 36.84 million hectares (88.4 million acres), which represents an increase of 2.7% compared to last year.
</p>
<p>
	The lower soybean production was the result of reduced yields.  Conab is now estimating the nationwide soybean yield at 3,266 kg/ha (48.3 bu/ac) compared to their April estimate of 3,313 kg/ha (49.0 bu/ac).
</p>
<p>
	Conab increased the 2019/20 Brazilian corn estimate 0.47 million tons to 102.3 million compared to their April estimate of 101.8 million tons.  All the increase in the corn estimate came from a larger safrinha corn production.  They are now projecting a safrinha corn production of 75.9 million tons compared to their April estimate of 75.4 million tons.
</p>
<p>
	The larger safrinha corn estimate was the result of increased acreage.  Conab is now estimating the 2019/20 Brazilian safrinha corn acreage at 13.783 million hectares (34.0 million acres), which represents an increase of 320,000 hectares (790,000 acres) compared to their April estimate.  If verified, the 2019/20 safrinha corn acreage would be 7% larger compared to a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
	Conab lowered the safrinha corn yield to 5,508 kg/ha (84.8 bu/ac) from the April estimate of 5,603 kg/ha (86.2 bu/ac).
</p>
<p>
	The full-season corn crop in Brazil now represents 24.6% of Brazil's total corn production with the safrinha crop representing 74.1% and the third crop representing 1.1%.
