Planting of the Safrinha Corn in Brazil Proceeding Slowly
<p>
Approximately 26% the safrinha corn in Brazil had been planted by last Friday compared to 36% last year and 31% for the 5-year average.  This represents an advance of 11% for the week.  The safrinha corn crop represents approximately 70% of Brazil's total corn production.

According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), the safrinha corn in Mato Grosso is 46.3% planted compared to 58.4% last year and 41.3% for the 5-year average.  This represents an advance of 19% for the week. The fastest planting pace is in the mid-north where 64% of the corn has been planted.  The slowest pace is in northeastern Mato Grosso where 14% has been planted.

	The safrinha corn planting in Parana remains very slow at just 9% compared to 33% last year and 33% for the 5-year average.  Wet weather has slowed the soybean harvest which in turn has slowed the safrinha corn planting.  AgRural commented last Friday that the safrinha corn acreage in Parana may decline more than the 8.4% they originally estimated.  For Brazil, they feel the safrinha corn acreage will decline 4.6%, but that does not include a potential lower acreage in Parana.

	In the reaming states, the safrinha corn planting is 12% complete in Minas Gerais, 11% in Mato Grosso do Sul, 10% in Goias, and 8% in Sao Paulo.

	The potential problem for the safrinha corn is going to be planting after the ideal window has closed.  In Mato Grosso, the third week of February is generally considered the end of the ideal planting window.  Farmers in Mato Grosso will generally not risk planting their corn past March 10-15 due to the crop not being able to complete grain filling before the onset of the next dry season.  The planting window is general similar for Goias and northern Mato Grosso do Sul.  In Parana, Sao Paulo, and southern Mato Grosso do Sul, the ideal window stays open until early March.
