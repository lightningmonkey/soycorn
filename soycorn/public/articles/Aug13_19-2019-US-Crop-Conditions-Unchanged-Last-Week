2019 U.S. Crop Conditions Unchanged Last Week
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2019 U.S. corn crop was unchanged last week at 57% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the corn condition improved last week while 9 states indicated that the corn condition declined last week and 2 states were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the southern and western Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the central Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are:  Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Nebraska, and Kentucky.  The five lowest rated corn states are:  Indiana, Ohio, N. Carolina, Missouri, and Illinois.

	The corn ratings usually decline during the month of August due to hotter and dryer conditions, but I think the lack of excessive heat has helped to compensate somewhat for the lack of moisture.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2019 U.S. soybean crop was unchanged last week at 54% rated good to excellent.  Six states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week while 10 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week and 2 states were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the southern locations while most of the declines were found across the central Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are:  Tennessee, Nebraska, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and Mississippi.  The five lowest rated soybean states are:  Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri.

	The soybean rating usually decline this time of the year as well, but some recent rains have helped to stabilize some of the soybeans.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture dried out again last week with 8 states indicating improved soil moisture and 10 states indicating declining soil moisture.  Most of the improvements were found in the southern and western locations while most of declines were found in the central and eastern locations.  The five states with the best soil moisture are:  South Dakota, Kansas, Wisconsin, Mississippi, and Minnesota.  The five driest states are:  Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and Arkansas.

	The topsoil moisture in the 18 principal crop producing states is now below the long term average for this point in the growing season.  This week should be one of the better weeks for rainfall across the central Corn Belt, so the soil moisture may now stabilize.
