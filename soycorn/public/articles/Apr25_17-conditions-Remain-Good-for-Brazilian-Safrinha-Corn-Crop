Conditions Remain Good for Brazilian Safrinha Corn Crop
<p>
	The weather for the Brazilian safrinha corn crop has generally been good, but it has been a little more variable in Mato Grosso.  In central Mato Grosso, where the concentration of safrinha corn is the highest, the weather has been very cooperative.  The weather has been much dryer in southern and southeastern Mato Grosso.  In the city of Rondonopolis for example (southeastern Mato Grosso), they have only received 0.3 inches of precipitation for the month of April.

The earlier planted corn in Mato Grosso has already pollinated and is well into the grain filling phase.  The later planted corn in Mato Grosso is approaching pollination.  The safrinha corn harvest in Mato Grosso will start by the end of May.

	For most of the corn in Mato Grosso, the crop is close to "being made."  Two or three more weeks of good weather and the crop will be far enough along in most areas of the state to make it through the grain filling phase.  There are some dry pockets in the state, but for the most part, the safrinha corn is doing fine.

	The weather in southern Brazil has improved for the safrinha corn in Parana, Sao Paulo, and southern Mato Grosso do Sul.  The weather during March was relatively dry, but the rainfall picked up during April and in fact, they received some additional rainfall over this past weekend.  The safrinha corn in Parana is maybe one-third pollinated with the later corn in vegetative development.  The safrinha corn in Parana is rated 97% in good condition.

	The forecast for this week is calling for more chances of showers in the safrinha corn areas of Mato Grosso and Parana.  A cold front is expected to drop temperatures in southern Brazil, but no frosts are forecasted for the safrinha corn areas of Parana.  The longer range forecast for the safrinha corn areas if Brazil looks dryer, but thus far this growing season, about the time we get concerned about dryness, more showers seem to move into the area.

	Brazilian farmers continue to be slow sellers of their anticipated safrinha corn crop.  According to Safras & Mercado, Brazilian farmers have sold 17% of the safrinha corn crop compared to 44.5% sold last year at this time.
