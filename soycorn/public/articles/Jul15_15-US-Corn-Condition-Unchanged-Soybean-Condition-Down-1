U.S. Corn Condition Unchanged, Soybean Condition down 1%
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. corn crop held steady last week at 69% rated good to excellent.  Eight states indicated that the corn condition improved last week and 8 states indicated that the corn condition declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the western Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are: Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa.  The five states with the lowest rated corn are: Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri, and Illinois.

	The nationwide condition of the corn crop remains essentially equal to the long term average, but the different halves of the Corn Belt are going in opposite directions.  The condition of the corn in the eastern Corn Belt continues to decline from too much water while the corn in the western Corn Belt is benefiting from improved growing conditions.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. soybean crop declined 1% last week and is now rated 62% good to excellent.  Six states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week, 7 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week, and 5 states were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the western Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are: Wisconsin, Mississippi, Tennessee, Iowa, and Minnesota.  The five states with the lowest rated soybeans are: Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and Kansas.

	The nationwide condition of the soybean crop is also rated equal to the long term average, but the soybeans are under more stress than the corn especially in the saturated areas of the eastern Corn Belt.  Many of the soybeans are still very small due to the saturated conditions and if these small soybeans don't put on significant growth very soon, their yield potential will be very low.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's topsoil got dryer last week with 4 states indicating that the soils got wetter last week and 13 states indicated that the soils got dryer last week.  Most of the soils that got wetter were in the eastern Corn Belt while most of the soils that got dryer were found in the western Corn Belt and the Delta.  The five states with then wettest soils are: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Kentucky.  The five states with the driest soils are: North Carolina, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Mississippi.

<p>
	The nation's topsoil dried out a little last week, but once again the different halves of the Corn Belt are going in different directions.  Much of the eastern Corn Belt remains saturated and this this week's rating does not include rains that fell Monday in the eastern Corn Belt.  We thought last year was wet, but as you can see on the graph, this year is significantly wetter than last year.
