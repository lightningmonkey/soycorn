U.S. Crop Conditions Hold Steady
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2016 U.S. corn crop held steady at 74% rated good to excellent.  Nine states indicated that the corn condition improved last week, 7 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week and 2 states indicated no change.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and northern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern and western Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, and Colorado.  The five lowest rated corn states are: Ohio, Michigan, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Texas.

	After declining a little last week, the condition of the corn crop held steady again this week.  With all the rainfall that has fallen over the weekend and more in the forecast, my guess is that the condition will hold steady again next week.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2016 U.S. soybean crop held steady last week at 72% rated good to excellent.  Eight states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week, 9 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week, 1 state indicated no change last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the central Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern and western Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are: Wisconsin, Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee, and Minnesota.  The five lowest rated soybean states are: Ohio, Michigan, South Dakota, Arkansas, and Kansas.

	The soybean condition also held steady again this week.  The August weather has been very beneficial for the soybeans and it looks like the good weather will continue.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's topsoil moisture improved last week with 14 states indicating that the soil moisture improved and 4 states indicating that the soil moisture declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found all across the Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the southern Corn Belt.  The top five rated states for soil moisture are: Louisiana, Minnesota, Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri.  The five lowest rated states for soil moisture are: Ohio, Michigan, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Nebraska.

<p>
	Interestingly, the soil moisture is now better than last year and my guess is that it will improve again next week.  It doesn't get any better than this in August for the soybean crop.
