Brazilian Farmers very hopeful concerning their 2019 Safrinha Corn
<p>
	Brazilian farmers are starting to harvest their 2019 safrinha corn crop, which is expected to represent more than 70% of Brazil's total corn production in 2018/19.
</p>
<p>
	The safrinha corn in Mato Grosso is 3.5% harvested compared to 0.7% harvested last year at this time.  The most advanced harvest is in the mid-north region where 4.6% of the safrinha corn has been harvested.

<p>
In Parana, the safrinha corn is 5% harvested and the corn is rated 3% poor, 13% average, and 84% good.  Farmers in the municipality of Cascavel, which is located in western Parana, are expecting safrinha corn yields in the range of 110 to 150 sacks per hectare (101 to 138 bu/ac), which would surpass last year's yield.

In the municipality of Coromandel, Minas Gerais, rains at the end of the growing season are expected to result in good corn yields in the range of 100 to 110 sacks per hectare (92 to 101 bu/ac).  After three disappointing corn yields in a row, farmers in the municipality are hoping for a "turn around" year in 2019.

<p>
In Mato Grosso do Sul the safrinha corn harvest is just getting underway.  In all of Brazil, the safrinha corn harvest should really pick up over the next 10 days.
</p>
<p>
	If the Brazilian safrinha corn yields turn out as good as farmers are hoping, the 2018/19 Brazilian corn crop could set a new record large production of 100 million tons, but I think it is too early to say that for sure since the corn harvest is less than 5% complete.  Within two weeks or so, we should have a much better idea if the Brazilian safrinha corn will live up to the early hype.
