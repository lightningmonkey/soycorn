Brazil Looking for Farmers Who Can Produce 124 bu/ac Soybeans
<p>
	Farmers in Brazil have until January 15, 2016 to enter their soybean field into the National Soybean Yield Contest conducted by Brazilian Strategic Soybean Committee (CESB).  Last year's winner was Alisson Hilgengerg from Ponta Grossa in eastern Parana who produced a record soybean yield of 141.8 sacks per hectare or 123 bu/ac.  CESB is hoping that a Brazilian farmer can even do better than last year's eye-popping yield.

The goal of the national yield contest is not to just produce another exceptional soybean yield, but to identify the best practices that commercial soybean producers could employ to maximize their yields and still produce soybeans in a sustainable manner.

Last year's winner produced his winning yield on a 13 hectare plot where he invested heavily in technology and monitored the crop constantly, but he is first to admit that the weather was the main factor in producing his record yield.  Besides being recognized as the "soybean yield king" of Brazil, he was also invited to accompany CESB officials on a technical visit to the United States.

The Brazilian National Soybean Yield Contest is divided into the following categories:  National Yield Champion Irrigated and Non-irrigated, Municipal Champions, State Champions, and Regional Champions (South, Southeast, Center-West, North and Northeast).  Farmers can enter 5-10 hectare plots that cannot be planted on natural preserved areas and they must adhere to best agronomic practices as well as workers' rights.  Last year there were 2,900 plots entered into the contest involving 9,000 professionals including: farmers, agronomist, and consultants

CESB is a non-profit organization that oversees the contest and it is composed of 17 member organizations including among others: Syngenta, BASF, Bayer, Monsanto, TMG, Sementes Adriana, Agrichem, UPL do Brasil, Stoller, Produquimica, Jacto, and Instituto Phytus, etc.  Its goal is to identify the best agronomic practices that can be applied on a wide scale basis to maximize soybean yields nationwide.
