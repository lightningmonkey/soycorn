Six Million Acres of 2019 U.S. Soybeans not yet Setting Pods
<p>
The 2019 U.S. soybean crop is 92% setting pods compared to 100% last year and 99% average.  Next week they will start reporting the percentage of soybeans dropping leaves, but some state have already reported soybean leaves dropping.  Individual Midwestern states such as South Dakota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota reported that some of the soybeans are turning yellow and dropping

I think crop development is still the major concern for the soybean crop.  Eight percent of the 2019 U.S. soybeans, or approximately 6 million acres, have still not started to set pods and it is already the second week of September.  There is a very low probability that a pod set this late in the growing season will end up with normal seeds.  Therefore, the yields on these 6 million acres could be 0 bu/ac in a worst case scenario and maybe 15 bu/ac in a best case scenario.

The states with the most soybeans that have not set pods include:  Indiana with 16%, Missouri 16%, Wisconsin 15%, Kentucky 13%, Kansas 11%, Michigan 11%, Ohio 11%, Illinois 10%, South Dakota 9%, Nebraska 6%,m and Iowa 6%.
