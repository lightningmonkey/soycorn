2019/20 Argentina Soybeans Stabilized with Improved Weather
<p>
The weather in Argentina has improved over the past several weeks and as a result, the dry areas of the country have shrunk.  It is now estimated that approximately 10-15% of the soybean and corn acreage in Argentina still has a moisture deficit.  The weather is far from perfect, but it has been good enough to stabilize the crops in Argentina.  The driest areas of Argentina are probably southwest Buenos Aires province and La Pampa province.

The full-season soybeans are approximately 91% planted and the double crop soybeans are approximately 27% planted.  In the core production areas, the soybeans are 97-100% planted with 60-80% planted in southern Argentina and 25-45% planted in northern Argentina.
