IMEA Lowers Mato Grosso's Safrinha Corn Yield
<p>
After the completion of the safrinha corn planting in the state, the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reduced their yield estimate for the safrinha corn.  They are now estimating that the statewide average yield will be 102.5 sacks per hectare (97.7 bu/ac), which is a decline of 3.56% compared to the 2019/20 crop.
</p>
<p>
The yield reduction is due to the fact that 45% of the safrinha corn was planted after the ideal window had closed on February 28th.  The safrinha corn planting was delayed due to a late planting of the soybeans and excessive rains that delayed the soybean harvest even more.

Moisture deficits generally start to appear in the state during April and May with the onset of the annual dry season.  Late planted safrinha corn will need good rains through the month of May or adequate subsoil moisture to sustain the crop until maturity.  It is possible that the late planted corn could run out of moisture before it reaches maturity.

Imea is currently estimating that farmers in Mato Grosso planted 5.68 million hectares of safrinha corn and that the state will produce 34.97 million tons in 2020/21, which would represent a decline of 1.3% compared to last year.

Mato Grosso is the largest safrinha corn producing state in Brazil responsible for approximately 44% of Brazil's safrinha corn production.  The second largest producing state is Parana at 16% followed by Mato Grosso do Sul at 13% and Goias at 12% according to Conab.  The safrinha crop represents nearly three quarters of Brazil's total corn production.
