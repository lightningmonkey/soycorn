U.S. Corn Condition Unchanged, Soybean Condition Up Slightly
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. corn crop held steady last week at 70% rated good to excellent.  Ten states indicated that the corn condition had improved last week and 6 states indicated that the corn condition had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and western areas while most of the declines were found in the eastern and southern areas.  The top five rated corn states are: Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Iowa, and Kentucky.  The five states with the lowest rated corn are: Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois.

	The corn crop continues to be rated below last year's crop, but above the long term average (see graph at end of report).  Even though there were more states that indicated that the corn condition had improved as opposed to states where the condition had declined, the improvements were very minor in most of the states.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. soybean crop improved 1% last week to 63% rated good to excellent.  Nine states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week and 7 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and western areas while most of the declines were found in the Delta and the mid-South.  The top five rated soybean states are: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Tennessee, and North Dakota.  The five states with the lowest rated soybeans are: Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and North Carolina.

	The soybean crop continues to be rated lower than last year's crop and only slightly better than the long term average (see graph at end of report).

	<b>Soil moisture</	b> - The nation's topsoil continued to dry out last week for the fifth week in a row.  Only the state of Iowa indicated that the soils got wetter last week while 17 states indicated that the soils got dryer last week.  The five states with the wettest soils are: Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio.  The five states with the driest soils are: Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nebraska, and Arkansas.
</p>
<p>
	With the exception of Iowa, which has received above normal precipitation for seven of the last eight weeks, all the other states reported a decline in soil moisture.  A decline in soil moisture is expected this time of the year (see graph at end of report) and the current decline is paralleling the decline we saw last year.  Even with the declines, the soil moisture this year continues to be above both last year and the long term average.
