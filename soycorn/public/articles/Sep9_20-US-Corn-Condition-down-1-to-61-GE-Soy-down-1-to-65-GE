U.S. Corn Condition down 1 to 61% G/E, Soy down 1 to 65% G/E
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2020 U.S. corn crop declined 1% last week to 61% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the corn condition improved last week, 8 states indicated that the corn condition declined last week, and 3 were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the eastern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the western Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are:  Wisconsin, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, and Tennessee.  The five lowest rated corn states are: Colorado, Iowa, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Texas.

	The corn is 79% dented compared to 51% last year and 71% average.  The corn is 25% mature compared to 10% last year and 19% average.  The corn is maturing quickly and the rains occurring in the Midwest this week are coming too late for any significant improvement in the corn crop.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2020 U.S. soybean crop declined 1% last week to 65% rated good to excellent.  Ten states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week while 8 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the eastern and southern locations while most of the declines were found in the western Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are:  Wisconsin, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, and Tennessee.  The five lowest rated soybean states are:  Iowa, Kansas, Ohio, North Carolina, and South Dakota.

	The soybeans are 20% dropping leaves compared to 7% last year and 16% average.  With 20% dropping leaves, that means that approximately 45% of the soybeans are turning yellow.  The rains that are occurring in the Midwest this week could help some of the later maturing soybeans.  I don't think they will add any bushels to the soybean crop, but instead they could help the crop maintain its current yield potential.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The soil moisture declined last week with 7 states indicating improved soil moisture and 11 states indicating lower soil moisture.  Most of the improvements were found in the eastern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the western and southern locations.  The five states with the best soil moisture are:  Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Minnesota.  The five states with the lowest soil moisture are:  Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Illinois, and a tie between Indiana and South Dakota.
