2020 U.S. Corn Condition Declines 2%, Soy Condition Unchanged
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2020 U.S. corn crop declined 2% last week to 71% rated good to excellent.  Nine states indicated that the corn condition improved last week, 8 states indicated that the corn condition declined, and 1 state was unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the northern and southern areas while most of the declines were found in the eastern and western areas.  The top five rated corn states are: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kentucky, and South Dakota.  The five lowest rated corn states are: Colorado, Kansas, Ohio, Michigan, and Texas.

	It was no surprise that the corn ratings declined last week given the generally hot and dry weather across the central Corn Belt.  This week looks even hotter, so I would suspect that the corn ratings will decline again next Monday.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2020 U.S. soybean crop was unchanged last week at 71% rated good to excellent.  Ten states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week, seven states indicated that the soybean condition declined, and one state was unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the northern and southern areas while most of the declines were found in the eastern and western areas.  The top five rated soybean states are: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Louisiana, and South Dakota.  The five lowest rated soybean states are: Ohio, Kansas, Michigan, Indiana, and Mississippi.

	I think the soybean condition was unchanged last week because shorter soybeans are less likely to exhibit moisture stress compared to corn. Given the forecast for this week, I suspect that the soybean condition will decline in next week's report.

<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's topsoil moisture declined last week with 7 states indicating improved soil moisture, 10 states indicating lower soil moisture, and 1 state was unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the northern and southern areas while most of the declines were found in the eastern and western areas.  The five states with the best soil moisture are: Mississippi, Kentucky, Minnesota, Louisiana, and Missouri.  The five states with the lowest soil moisture are: Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Nebraska

<p>
	Given the high temperatures and generally dry conditions last week, it is not a surprise that the soil moisture declined last week.  The forecast is also calling for more hot and dry conditions this week, so if the forecast verifies, the soil moisture will decline again next Monday.  The Drought Monitor last Thursday indicated that dryness increased in the eastern Corn Belt and four of the five driest states are in the eastern Corn Belt.
