Brazilian Cotton Loses Acreage to Soybeans
<p>
	As Brazilian cotton farmers start to plant their 2012/13 crop, they have sharply curtailed the cotton acreage for 2012/13.  Conab estimated that the Brazilian cotton acreage will decline 28% from 1.39 million hectares planted in 2011/12 to 1.00 million hectares in 2012/13.  The number one cotton state remains Mato Grosso with 544,000 hectares (54% of Brazil's total cotton acreage) followed by Bahia with 292,000 hectares (30% of the total acreage).  The cotton acreage in Mato Grosso is down 25% compared to last year and Bahia is down 30%.

	The cotton crop in Mato Grosso is approximately 5% planted with the greatest concentration of cotton in the southeastern region of the state where about 10% has been planted.  The full-season cotton in Mato Grosso is generally planted in December and the <i>safrinha</i> cotton, which is planted following soybeans, can be planted until the end of January.  The Mato Grosso cotton crop is harvested generally during June, July, and August.

The cotton in the state of Bahia is planted during December and January and harvested June to September.  Much of the cotton in western Bahia is irrigated and it is planted during January.

	Farmers in Mato Grosso have sold 80% of their 2011/12 crop and approximately 49% of their anticipated 2012/13 production.
