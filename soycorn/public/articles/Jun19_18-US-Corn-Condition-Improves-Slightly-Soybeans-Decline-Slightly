U.S. Corn Condition Improves Slightly, Soybeans Decline Slightly
<p>
<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2018 U.S. corn crop improved 1% last week to 78% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the corn condition improved last week, 7 states indicated that the corn condition declined last week, and 4 states were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and northern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the southern locations.  The top five rated corn states are:  Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Illinois, and Iowa.  The five lowest rated corn states are: Texas, Missouri, North Carolina, Kansas, and Pennsylvania.

	It is not unusual for the corn rating to improve slightly in mid-June as the crop takes on a dark green color and starts to grow rapidly, especially when it is warm and wet like it has been in many areas.  The rainfall over the weekend fell mainly across the northern Midwest, but the forecast for this week is calling for rain across the central Corn Belt.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2018 U.S. soybean crop declined 1% last week to 73% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week, 9 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week, and 2 were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the northern locations while most of the declines were found in the southern locations.  The top five rated soybean states are:  Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Iowa, and Kentucky.  The five lowest rated soybean states are: Missouri, Kansas, North Carolina, Louisiana, and South Dakota.

	The high temperatures resulted in a slight decline in the soybean rating, which was most pronounced in the southern locations.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The soil moisture in the U.S. dried out a little more last week with 10 states indicating that the soil moisture improved last week and 7 states indicating that the soil moisture declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the northern locations and the Delta while most of the declines were found in the southern locations.  The top five rated states for soil moisture are:  Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan.  The five lowest rated
states for soil moisture are: Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Nebraska.

	The nationwide soil moisture continues to be rated slightly below average for mid-June.  The ring-of-fire rainfall pattern over the weekend resulted in continued good soil moisture in parts of the upper Midwest and dryer conditions in the southern Midwest and the Delta.  States such as Minnesota and Wisconsin are only rated 4% and 9% short to very short on soil moisture respectively, whereas Missouri is rated 57% short to very short, Kansas is 54% short to very short and Arkansas is 46% short to very short
