U.S. Corn 49% Planted (Avg. is 80%), Soybeans 19% (Avg. is 47%)
<p>
The 2018/19 U.S. corn crop is 49% planted compared to 78% last year and 80% for the 5-year average.  This represents an advance of 19% for the week.  The planting pattern continues to be the same - more planting progress in the western and southwestern areas with much less progress in the eastern and northwestern Corn Belt.

Iowa reported 70% of the corn planted (average is 89%), Nebraska is 70% (average is 86%), and Kansas is 61% (average is 80%).  In the eastern Corn Belt, the corn in Illinois is 24% planted (average is 89%), Indiana is 14% (average is 73%), and Ohio is 9% (average is 62%).  In the northwestern Corn Belt, the corn in Minnesota is 56% planted (average is 79%), South Dakota is 19% (average is 76%), and North Dakota is 42% (average is 63%).

	Corn emergence is also very slow at 19% compared to 47% last year and 49% for the 5-year average.  It is always good to remember that the growing season starts when the corn emerges and not when it is planted.  The emergence of the corn that was planted in the northern Corn Belt last week will be delayed due to the very cool temperatures over the weekend and early this week.

	If the corn emergence is delayed due to cold and wet soils, a number of problems could develop including:  lower than desired plant populations, delayed early growth, slower uptake of nutrients, increased chances of root diseases, and eventually the possibility of lower yields.

It is May 20th and only 49% of the corn has been planted making this year one of the slowest years.  These delays could result in more prevent plant than anticipated, fewer planted acres especially for corn, and the possibility of lower yields, especially for corn.

The 2019 U.S. soybean crop is 19% planted compared to 53% last year and 47% for the 5-year average.  This represents an advance of 10% for the week.  The most advanced planting is in the southern and southwestern areas.  Soybean emergence is 5% compared to 24% last year and 17% for the 5-year average.

I think it is too early to say anything definitive about the 2019 U.S. soybean crop other than to say that there could be more soybeans planted than anticipated and that the soybean yield might be lower than anticipated.
