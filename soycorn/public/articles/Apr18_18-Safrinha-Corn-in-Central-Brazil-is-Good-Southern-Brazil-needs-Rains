Safrinha Corn in Central Brazil is Good, Southern Brazil needs Rain
<p>
The safrinha corn we saw in central Brazil looked very good and I would say better than I expected.  The majority of the corn was in pre-pollination with the most advanced corn already into mid-grain filling.  The most delayed corn was 1-2 feet tall and there were a few isolated fields where the corn was maybe six inches tall.  The crop looked healthy, robust, with a good color, and the soil moisture was more than adequate.  In some areas, there was standing water in the rows and at the ends of the fields.  The safrinha corn in central Brazil is going to do very well.

The situation of the safrinha corn in southern Brazil is a little less certain.  Dry weather is starting to be a concern for the safrinha corn in Parana and southern Mato Grosso do Sul.  After receiving generally good rains during March, the weather dried out at the end of March and into April.  In some parts of Parana there has not been any rain for over two weeks and there is not much rain in the forecast.

Isolated fields of safrinha corn in Parana are already exhibiting moisture stress, and the stress will get worse as long as the rainfall is limited.  The safrinha corn in Parana is 90% in vegetative development, 9% pollinating, and 1% filling grain.  The safrinha corn in Mato Grosso do Sul is very similar to the corn in Parana.

There is also the potential for cold weather and frosts to impact the late planted safrinha corn in Parana and Mato Grosso do Sul.  The region has already had a couple of "near misses" of frost, which is extremely early for such low temperatures.  The states of Parana and southern Mato Grosso do Sul can experience a frost by the end of May.  If that were to occur, it would impact the later planted safrinha corn which will pollinate in about mid-May. The bottom line is that the safrinha corn crop in Brazil looks good for the time being, but it still has a long way to go before harvest.
