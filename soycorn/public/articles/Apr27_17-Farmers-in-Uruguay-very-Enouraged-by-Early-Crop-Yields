Farmers in Uruguay very Encouraged by Early Crop Yields
<p>
	Farmers in Uruguay are reporting very strong grain yields similar to those reported in southern Brazil.  The soybean harvest in Uruguay is 30% to 50% complete depending on the region.  According to the advisory firm Tardaguila Agromercados, the average soybean yield thus far is 3,000 per hectare (43.5 bu/ac).  In a few isolated instances, the soybean yield is as high as 4,000 kg/ha (58 bu/ac).

	These are very good soybean yields for Uruguay and many regions are registering soybean yield increases of 10% to 25% compared to last year.  The Uruguayan Minister of Agriculture is expecting a soybean production of 3.3 million tons.  Soybeans are produced in two regions in Uruguay.  One region is in the northern part of the country along the border with the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.  The other region is in the western part of the country along the border with the Argentine province of Entre Rios.

	Farmers in Uruguay are also very encouraged by their early corn yields as well.  According to agronomist Felipe Gonzalez from Procampo Uruguay, the corn harvest is approximately 30% complete with many corn yields in the range of 7,500 kg/ha (116 bu/ac) and some as high as 11,000 kg/ha (169 bu/ac).
