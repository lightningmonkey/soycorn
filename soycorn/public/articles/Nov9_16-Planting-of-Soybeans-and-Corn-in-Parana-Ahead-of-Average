Planting of Soybeans and Corn in Parana Ahead of Average
<p>
	The weather thus far this planting season in the state of Parana in southern Brazil has generally been good and farmers have taken advantage of the situation to plant their corn and soybean crops at a faster than average pace.  The 2016/17 soybean crop in the state is 80% planted compared to 75% last year.  In the western regions of the state, the soybean planting is already complete.

	Parana is the second leading soybean and safrinha corn producing state in Brazil and this rapid soybean planting pace means that there should be plenty of time to plant the second crop of corn within the ideal planting window next January and February.  Farmers want to plant the safrinha corn as early as possible because he earlier the safrinha corn is planted, the lower the potential risk from cold weather impacting the crop before it reaches maturity.

	Farmers in Parana have also planted their full-season corn at a faster-than-normal pace.  The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) is estimating that the full-season corn is 99% planted compared to 91% last year at this time.

	Parana is the largest wheat producing state in Brazil and Deral estimates that 85% of the 2015/16 wheat crop in the state has been harvested compared to 82% last year.
