	U.S. farmers made good planting progress once again last week with 80% of the corn planted and 61% of the soybeans planted.  The soybean planting is 24% ahead of average while the corn is 12% ahead of average.  Planting is more advanced in the western Corn Belt compared to the eastern Corn Belt due to dryer conditions in the west and wetter conditions in the east. Planting continues to be slow in the Delta and southern Corn Belt due to wet conditions.
