Anticipated Increase of Double Crop Soy Acres May be in Doubt
<p>
	As the dry conditions persist in much of the central and eastern Corn Belt, there are some doubts growing about the 2 million additional acres of U. S. double crop soybeans that we had anticipated earlier in the spring.  The wheat will be harvested earlier than normal no doubt, but not all the double cropped soybeans may be planted if it remains this dry for several more weeks.

	If the soil is bone-dry when the wheat is harvested, most farmers would wait to plant their soybeans until there is adequate soil moisture to insure germination and stand establishment.  If the soil is too hard and dry they may also have a difficult time getting the no-till planter to work properly so that is another reason to wait until they get a shower before they plant their double crop soybeans.

The window for planting double crop soybeans is still open until early July especially in the southern locations, but in the more of the northern locations, the planting window will be closed generally by the end of June.  It is in these more northern locations where all the anticipated double crop soybean acres may not materialize. The areas of concern are central Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.  It's still too early to say for sure that these anticipated double crop acres will not occur because all it takes is one good rain to encourage the farmers to plant their double crop soybeans.

	It's not as if none of those two million additional acres of double crop soybeans get planted, but instead of 2.0 million more acres, a more realistic number might be 1.5 million additional acres.  But as I mentioned, it's still too early to say for sure what will happen.
