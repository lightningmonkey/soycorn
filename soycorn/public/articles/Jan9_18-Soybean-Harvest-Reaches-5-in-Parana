Soybean Harvest reaches 5% in Parana
<p>
	The Department of Rural Economics for the State of Parana (Deral) reported that farmers in the state have started to harvest their 2018/19 soybean crop.  Deral reports that 5% of the soybeans have been harvested compared to no soybeans harvested last year at this time.  The soybean harvest started earlier this year because the farmers in Parana planted some of the first soybeans in Brazil this growing season.  Additionally, the maturity of some of the soybeans is being accelerated due to the recent dry weather.

<p>
	Western and southwestern Parana experienced hot and dry conditions during the month of December when the early maturing soybeans were filling pods.  As a result, it is the earliest maturing soybeans that were most impacted by the hot and dry conditions. These two regions of the state account for 30% of Parana's total soybean production.

<p>
	Deral is reporting that 12% of the soybeans in the state are rated poor, 30% are rated average, and 58% are rated good.  In some of the worst areas, farmers are reporting yields 40% below what had been expected.  Deral is scheduled to release their next soybean crop estimate on January 21st.

	Rainfall across the state has generally been below average for the last 60 days.  In western Parana, the rainfall deficit for the last 60 days is 5 inches.  In southwestern areas, the deficit is 4 inches.

	Farmers in Parana have not yet started to harvest their full-season corn, but they have already planted 3% of their intended safrinha corn acreage. Last year at this time, none of the safrinha corn had been planted.
