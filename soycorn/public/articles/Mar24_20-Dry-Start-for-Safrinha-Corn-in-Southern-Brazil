Dry Start for Safrinha Corn in Southern Brazil
<p>
The safrinha corn in the southern production areas of Brazil including the states of Parana, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Sao Paulo are getting off to a less than ideal start.  Dry weather has impacted the early crop development and farmers are worried about potential yield reductions.

 	<b>Mato Grosso safrinha corn</b> - The safrinha corn in Mato Grosso is 100% planted according to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea).  Corn prices in Mato Grosso increased 0.5% last week to R$ 39.68 (approximately $4.35 per bushel), which is record high. The high prices are the result of the weaker Brazilian currency, tight corn supplies, increased demand to make ethanol, and record corn exports in 2019.

<b>Goias safrinha corn</b> - In the municipality of Cristalina, which is located in eastern Goias, the safrinha corn planting is complete.  The 70% of the safrinha corn that is irrigated is developing well.  The dryland safrinha corn was planted about 10 days later than normal.  If the summer rains continue until early May, farmers in the region are expecting corn yields in the range of 100 sacks per hectare (92.4 bu/ac).  The municipality of Cristalina has the highest amount of irrigated crops in central Brazil.

<b>Parana safrinha corn</b> - According to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral), as of earlier last week, the safrinha corn in Parana was 90% planted and the corn was rated 7% average and 93% good.  Three percent of the corn had already started to pollinate.  There are concerns in the northwestern part of the state that dry conditions have hurt the early development of the safrinha corn.  In the municipality of Doutor Camargo, which is located in northwestern Parana, the safrinha corn was planted about 10 days later than normal and 30% to 40% of the corn is sub-par in its development.
