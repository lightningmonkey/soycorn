2020 U.S. Crop Condition-Split Decision, Corn up 1% Soy Down 2%
<p>
<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2020 U.S. corn crop improved 1% last week to 72% rated good to excellent.  Six states indicated that the corn condition improved last week while 10 states indicated that the corn condition declined last week and 2 were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the western Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are:  Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and South Dakota.  The five lowest rated corn states are:  Colorado, Kansas, Texas, Indiana, and Ohio.

	Last week's decline of 4% was probably a little over done, so I think this week's ratings sound more reasonable.  The area to watch going forward is the eastern Corn Belt.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2020 U.S. soybean crop declined 2% last week to 70% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week while 11 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the western and southern areas while most of the declines were found in the eastern and northern areas.  The top five rated soybean states are:  Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kentucky, and South Dakota.   The five lowest rated soybean states are: Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, and Illinois.

	With a decline of 2% in this week's good to excellent rating to 70%, it puts the soybeans more in line with the corn rating.  The area to watch for the soybeans is also the eastern Corn Belt which has four of the five lowest rated soybean states.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture declined last week with 5 states indicating improved soil moisture and 13 states indicating lower soil moisture.  Most of the improvements were found in the western and southern areas while most of the lower soil moisture were found in the eastern and northern areas.  The five states with the highest soil moisture are: North Carolina, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Kansas, and a tie between Missouri and South Dakota.  The five states with the lowest soil moisture are:  Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Nebraska, and Michigan.

	Showers last week and over the weekend favored the west-central Midwest including Minnesota, northern and eastern Iowa, Wisconsin, and northwestern Illinois.  Much of Illinois and Indiana missed out on significant rain and Indiana and Ohio are two of the five driest states.  The forecast is calling for more chances of rain this week with reduced chances next week.
