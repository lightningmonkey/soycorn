Argentine Planting Progressing at Average Pace
<p>
<b>Argentina Soybeans</b> - The weather in Argentina has been typical springtime weather, some areas too wet and some areas too dry.  The forecast looks like it might be dryer-than-normal going forward.  In the short term, that would be positive, but if the pattern persists for an extended period of time, it would turn negative.  The Brazilian National Weather Service is forecasting a dryer-than-normal pattern across north-central and northern Argentina during this growing season.

	The soybean crop in Argentina is 7.2% planted according to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange.  This represents an advance of 5% for the week and the planting is slightly slower than last year.  Approximately 45% of the soybeans planted thus far have been in the northern core region with another 27% planted in the southern corn region.  Approximately one million hectares were planted in Argentina during the past week.

<b>Argentina Corn</b> - Corn planting in Argentina slowed down last week, which is typical for this time of the year.  Corn planting during November will continue to be slow and then it will pick up again in the early days of December.
