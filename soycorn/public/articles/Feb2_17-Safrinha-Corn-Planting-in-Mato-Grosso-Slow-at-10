Safrinha Corn Planting in Mato Grosso slow at 10%
<p>
	The early soybean harvest in Mato Grosso has been slowed by wet weather over the last several weeks and that in turn, has slowed the early safrinha corn planting as well.

According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), farmers in Mato Grosso have planted 10% of their anticipated safrinha corn and Imea had anticipated that 16% would be planted by this date.  Despite the slow start, the safrinha corn planting is still 4.8% ahead of last year's pace which was very slow due to delays in getting the soybeans planted.

Based on when the soybeans were planted last September and the maturity groups of the soybeans, Imea had anticipated that 33% of the safrinha corn would be planted by early next week, but that goal will probably not be achieved.

The ideal planting window for safrinha corn in Mato Grosso closes approximately on February 20th.  If necessary, safrinha corn can be planted in Mato Grosso until mid-March, but the late planted corn runs a significant risk of encountering dry weather before the crop can complete the grain filling process.
