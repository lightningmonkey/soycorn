Grain Inspectors Selectively Strike Exporters in Argentina
<p>
	The union representing grain inspectors in Argentina (Urgara) continue to be on strike against selective private grain exporters in Argentina.  The strike, which started on December 9th, continues to disrupt exports from Argentina, which is the largest exporter of soybean meal and a major exporter of soybeans, corn, and wheat.

	The workers on strike are technicians that analyze gain shipments at ports that are mainly outside of the main port hub of Rosario.  The strike continues against the T6 terminal north of Rosario, which is operated by Bunge and the Argentine firm AGD.  The work stoppage is also impacting ports in the city of Bahia Blanca operated by Cargill and Louis Dreyfus as well as a port operated by Cofco International in the city of Lima north of Buenos Aires.

	Originally, the grain inspectors joined with soybean crushing plant workers The original strike by union workers at soybean crushing plants ended last week, which has allowed for crushing activity to resume.  During the strike, farmers were prohibited from entering export terminals with grain they were hoping to sell, but now farmers are calling for a 72-hour commercial strike to protest the government's announcement last week of a temporary suspension of corn export registrations until the end of February.
