2016 U.S. Crop Conditions Improve Last Week
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2016 U.S. corn crop improved 1% last week to 76% rated good to excellent.  Eight states indicated that the corn condition had improved, 8 states indicated that the corn condition had declined, and 2 states indicated no change in the corn condition.  Most of the improvements were found in the central Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in southern and northern states.  The top five rated corn states are: Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota, Iowa, and Pennsylvania.  The five lowest rated corn states are: Michigan, South Dakota, Kansas, North Carolina, and Texas.

	The corn crop just keeps rolling along in very good condition and it looks like the weather this week will once again be beneficial for the crop.  The dry areas continue to shrink and I see no problem with pollination this year.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2016 U.S. soybean crop improved 1% last week to 71% rated good to excellent.  Eleven states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week, 5 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week, and 2 states indicated no change.  Most of the improvements were found across the Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the southern areas.  The top five rated soybean states are: Wisconsin, Tennessee, Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota.  The five lowest rated soybean states are: Arkansas, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and South Dakota.

<p>
	After a couple weeks of small declines, the soybean condition ticked higher this week with the abundant rainfall that fell last week across many of the previously dry areas.  It looks like it is going to be another positive week for the soybean crop this week as well.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's topsoil moisture improved last week with 16 states indicating improved soil moisture and only two states indicating declining soil moisture.  The improvements were found all across the Corn Belt while the only two declining states were Louisiana and Ohio.  The five states with the best soil moisture are: Kentucky, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin.  The five states with the worst soil moisture are: Arkansas, Mississippi, Michigan, Ohio, and South Dakota.
</p>
<p>
	The soil moisture improved after several weeks of declines.  Improving soil moisture in the middle of July is very important in insuring adequate moisture during what could be the hottest time of the year.
