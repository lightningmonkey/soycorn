Argentina Corn Planting Lags Last Year
<p>
	<b>Argentina weather</b> - The springtime weather in Argentina has generally been wetter than average especially in central Buenos Aires and other areas of eastern Argentina.  It has not been as wet in central and northern areas allowing for corn planting to progress in those areas.  Going forward, it looks like it will remain wet enough to only allow for moderate planting progress in Argentina.

	<b>Argentina corn</b> - Farmers in Argentina continue planting their 2012/13 corn crop at a slower pace than last year.  Approximately 27-28% of the corn had been planted compared to 32-33% last year.  The most corn has been planted in the center-north and northern locations where 50% to 75% of the intended corn has been planted.  In the southern locations, 5% to 10% has been planted and 5% of the intended corn acres have been planted in the far northern locations.

	In the areas where the heaviest rainfall has occurred, there have been some problems with emergence and early plant growth and some of the corn will need to be replanted.  In the flooded areas of central Buenos Aires, they will need a prolonged period of dry weather before they will be able to get into the fields.  Most of the early corn is in good condition with the exception of the corn impacted by localized flooding and frost damage from several weeks ago.

	<b>Argentina Soybeans</b> - As farmers in Argentina finish planting their corn crop they will start to plant their 2012/13 soybean crop.  No official estimates of the soybean planting pace have been released as yet, but there have probably been a few fields of soybeans already planted in Argentina.  Soybean planting in Argentina generally starts in October, so now is the time to start planting the 2012/13 soybean crop.
