Delayed Soybean Planting in Brazil could Impact Safrinha Corn
<p>
	Since more than 70% of Brazil's corn will be produced as a safrinha crop after the first crop of soybeans are harvested, any delays in getting the safrinha corn planted could negatively impact potential yields.
</p>
<p>
I am maintaining a lower bias for the 2019/20 Brazilian corn production due to the delayed soybean planting especially in the states of Parana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo, and Goias.  The delayed soybean planting will delay the planting of the safrinha corn and it is already expected that some of the corn will be planted after the ideal planting window closes about the third week of February.  Farmers are already commenting that an extended rainy season will be needed next April and May to insure good corn yields.

The ideal planting window for safrinha corn closes about February 20th and the maximum farmers can wait to plant their corn is about March 10-15.  If the corn is planted after that date, the crop would not reach maturity before the onset of the dry season in Brazil.

The full-season corn in Rio Grande do Sul is 77% planted with 92% germinating/vegetative development and 8% pollinating.  The full-season corn in Parana was 92% planted.  The corn is in vegetative development and is rated 1% poor, 11% average, and 88% good.
