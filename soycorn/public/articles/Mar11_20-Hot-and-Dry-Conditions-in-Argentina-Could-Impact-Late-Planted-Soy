Hot and Dry Conditions in Argentina could Impact Late Planted Soy
<p>
The weather last week in Argentina was generally hot and dry.  In some of the southwestern production areas, they have gone 2-3 weeks without any significant rain.  The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange indicated that drought was a concern in western Buenos Aires province and in La Pampa. These adverse conditions are coming at a particularly bad time for the soybeans that are generally filling pods.  The soybean growth cycle in Argentina would be the equivalent of about mid-August in the United States.

	We have noted many times in the past that the soils in Argentina have a very good water holding capacity and that it takes a while for moisture stresses to develop.  After several weeks of hot and dry weather, it now looks like moisture stresses are occurring.
</p>
<p>
	There is some hope in the forecast for some showers this week and improved chances of rainfall next week, especially in southern Argentina.
</p>
<p>
	The soybeans in general are 47% filling pods and 12% mature and the crop is rated 8% poor to very poor (last week was 0%), 43% fair (last week was 29%), and 50% good to excellent (last week was 71%).  The soil moisture for the soybeans was rated 23% short to very short (last week was 4%) and 76% favorable to optimum (last week was 96%).  Needless to say, the hot and dry weather is negatively impacting the crop.

<p>
	The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange left their soybean estimate unchanged at 54.5 million tons and they stated that their soybean estimate would probably not go any higher.

<p>
	In their March WASDE Report, the USDA increased their 2019/20 Argentina soybean estimate 1.0 million tons to 54.0 million tons.
