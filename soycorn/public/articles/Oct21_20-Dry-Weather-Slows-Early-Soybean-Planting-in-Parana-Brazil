Dry Weather Slows Early Soybean Planting in Parana, Brazil
<p>
	Soybean planting in the state of Parana in southern Brazil continues to get off to a slow start.  Dry weather kept many farmers out of the field until this past weekend when the state did receive some light and scattered showers.  More rain is needed later this week and into next week to insure adequate germination and stand establishment.

Soybean planting in the municipality of Maringa, which is located in northern Parana, is progressing about a month slower than desired due to the dry conditions.  Even though planting is delayed, farmers in the region are still hoping for soybean yields to average approximately 60 sacks per hectare (53.6 bu/c), which would be a significant improvement over last year's yield of 50 sacks per hectare (44.7 bu/ac).

The 2019/20 soybean yields were negatively impacted by a prolonged period of dry weather from late November through early January.  The dry weather hit as the soybeans were in the midst of pod filling.

Farmers in the region are already concerned about their 2020/21 safrinha corn.  The month delay in soybean planting is going to push the planting of the safrinha corn back to late February or more likely early March, which is outside of the ideal planting window.  Safrinha corn planted that late runs the risk of frost before the crop is mature.
