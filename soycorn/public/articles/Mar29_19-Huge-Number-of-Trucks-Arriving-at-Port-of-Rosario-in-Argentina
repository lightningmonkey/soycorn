Huge Number of Trucks arriving at Port of Rosario in Argentina
<p>
	Farmers in Argentina have harvested 12.2% of their 2018/19 corn crop and 1.6% of their soybean crop according to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange and the grain is already heading to the ports.  The corn harvest is a little over 50% complete in the northern core area as well as in the province of Entre Rios.  Early yield reports point to potentially record large yields especially for corn in the core production areas of Argentina.
