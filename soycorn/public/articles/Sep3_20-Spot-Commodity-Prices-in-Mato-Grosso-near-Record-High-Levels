Spot Commodity Prices in Mato Grosso near Record High Levels
<p>
	Farmers in Mato Grosso, Brazil are getting ready to start planting their 2020/21 soybeans in less than two weeks and they are looking at some very good commodity prices.  The available soybean supplies in Brazil are very tight and crushers have been bidding up the prices on the spot market.

The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported that the average spot price for soybeans in the state last week was R$ 124.83 per sack (approximately $10.70 per bushel), which was up 3.7% compared to the R$ 120.28 the prior week (approximately $10.31 per bushel).  The March soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade increased 1.9% last week due to dryness concerns across the Corn Belt.
