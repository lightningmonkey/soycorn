U.S. Crop Conditions Improve Slightly
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2016 U.S. corn crop held steady last week at 76% rated good to excellent.  Ten states indicated that the corn condition had improved last week, 7 states indicated that the corn condition had declined last week, and 1 state indicated no change.  Most of the improvements were found in the central Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern and western Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are: Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Colorado.  The five lowest rated corn states are: Ohio, Texas, South Dakota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.

<p>
	While the combined good to excellent rating remained at 76%, there was a one point shift from the good to the excellent category which resulted in an overall improvement in the crop condition.  This is a very good rating for the 1st of August.

<p>
	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2016 U.S. soybean crop improved 1% last week to 72% rated good to excellent.  Twelve states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week, 4 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week, and 2 states indicated no change.  Most of the improvements were found in the central Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern and western Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are:  Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Illinois.  The five lowest rated soybean states are: Arkansas, Ohio, Michigan, Kansas, and South Dakota.
</p>
<p>
	Only four states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week - Ohio, North Carolina, South Dakota, and Nebraska.  The condition of the crop has been on a slightly upward trajectory the last 3-4 weeks.  This is a very good sign for the crop as we move into August.

<p>
	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture basically held steady last week with 10 states indicating that the soil moisture improved last week and 7 states indicated that the soil moisture declined.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and southern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the northern Corn Belt.  The five states with the best soil moisture are: Kentucky, Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Louisiana.  The five states with the worst soil moisture are: Ohio, South Dakota, Michigan, Nebraska, and Tennessee.
</p>
<p>
	The nation's soil moisture is now almost at the same level as it was last year, which is surprising given all the rain that fell last summer.  This is a very good soil moisture reading for the 1st of August and there is more rainfall in the forecast for this week.
