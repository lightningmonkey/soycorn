Dryer Weather aids Soybean Harvest in Mato Grosso
<p>
	The recent weather in Mato Grosso has turned somewhat dryer allowing the soybean harvest to accelerate.  According to a report in SoNoticias, the president of the local Rural Syndicate in the municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde estimates that farmers in the area have harvested 40% of their 2015/16 soybean crop, which is about on par with recent years.  Lucas do Rio Verde is located in central Mato Grosso and is known for being the area in Brazil where some of the first soybeans are planted during the second half of September.

	Unfortunately, hot and dry weather delayed the planting this growing season and the irregular rains during October and November impacted the early planted soybeans.  Farmers who received rains shortly after planting are harvesting a relatively good soybean crop.  Farmers who did not receive timely rains are harvesting very poor yielding soybeans.

The early soybean harvest during January was slowed down by wet weather as farmers tried to harvest between the showers even going from one end of the field to the other end looking for the driest soybeans.  In some cases the farmers were desperate to get the soybeans out of the field before the quality started to deteriorate and they harvested soybeans with moistures as high as 25%.  Fortunately, the weather has recently dried out in Mato Grosso allowing for more continuous harvesting.

Soybean yields in the municipality continue to be highly variable ranging from 10 to 60 sacks per hectare (9 to 52 bu/ac).  Soybean yields within an individual field can vary from 45 to 60 sacks per hectare (39 to 52 bu/ac) depending on the rainfall.  The soybean harvest in the municipality should be completed during the second half of March.
