2020/21 Argentina Soybeans 20% Planted, Problematic Weather
<p>
The weather over the last two weeks has generally been favorable for soybean planting especially in the central and southern areas.  Weekend rains benefited the more western areas while the eastern areas stayed mostly dry.  Dryness remains a concern in parts of Santa Fe, entre Rios, and eastern Buenos Aires.  The weather this week is expected to be mostly dry across Argentina with improved chances of rain next week.  Dryer weather has slowed planting in the north-central and northern areas as well as in the eastern province of entre Rios.

The concern for the soybeans is the generally dry start to the growing season and the fact that the longer range forecasts are calling for dryer than normal conditions at least through November and December.

	The soybeans in Argentina were 19.9% planted late last week compared to 20% last year and 24.2% average according to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange.  This represents an advance of 16% for the week, which is a good week of planting.  In the core production areas, the soybeans are about 45% to 55% planted with about 10% to 30% planted in southern Argentina and no soybeans planted in far northern Argentina.
