After a Problematic Start, South American Weather Improving
<p>
After a problematic start to the growing season in both Brazil and Argentina, the recent weather in both countries seems to have taken a turn to what is more normal for this time of the year.  The rainfall in Brazil started to improve during the second half of December and it continued improving into January.  The rainfall over the last week or two in Brazil has been more typical for what is usually the peak of the summer rainy season.

In much of central Brazil there has been nearly constant heavy overcast for the last several weeks with multiple rain episodes during the day or night and high humidity, which is typical weather for the peak of the rainy season.

	The weather in Argentina started out problematic as well, but it has shown improvement in recent weeks.  The weather in Argentina is not as good as it is in Brazil, but it has been good enough to partially recharge the soil moisture especially across the central and northern parts of the country.

	The growing season is not over of course and additional rainfall will be needed in Brazil into March for the soybeans and into May for the safrinha corn.  The crops in Argentina will continue to need rain through April and May.  With that said, I think we can say that the weather has "turned the corner" in Brazil and Argentina, at least for the time being.
