Brazil Ends 2020/21 Season with 347 Cases of Soybean Rust
<p>
Brazil is ending the 2020/21 growing season with a total of 347 confirmed cases of soybean rust.  There still might be a few more confirmed cases since the soybean harvest is very late this year.
</p>
<p>
The number of cases started off very low, but increased rainfall starting in mid-January and continuing through mid-March, resulted in a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases.   The two southern states of Rio Grande do Sul and Parana accounted for 68% of the total number of cases in Brazil.  In the state of Mato Grosso, which is the largest soybean producing state in Brazil, they recorded only 4 cases of soybean rust.

<p>
Last year at this time, there had been 191 confirmed cases.  The 5-year average of cases is 393 and the 15-year average is 1056.  The worst year was 2008/09 when there had been 3514 confirmed cases by this time and the best year was 2019/20 with 191 cases.

The number of cases by state are:  135 in Rio Grande do Sul, 100 in Parana, 27 in Bahia, 25 in Mato Grosso do Sul, 17 in Santa Catarina, 10 in Tocantins, 9 in Goias, 8 in Sao Paulo, 7 in Piaui, 4 in  Mato Grosso, 4 in Minas Gerais, and 1 in Maranhao.
