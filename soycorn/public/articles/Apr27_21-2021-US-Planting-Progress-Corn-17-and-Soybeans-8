2021 U.S. Planting Progress - Corn 17% and Soybeans 8%
<p>
Cold weather last week slowed down spring planting and the emergence of crops that had already been planted.  Heavy rains in the Delta and southern U.S. also slowed planting progress.  Planters will be rolling early this week especially in the western areas as farmers take advantage of the warmer temperatures.  The forecast is calling for heavier precipitation this week across the Delta, southern and eastern Corn Belt, and the southeastern U.S.  Dryer weather is expected across the western and northwestern Corn Belt.
