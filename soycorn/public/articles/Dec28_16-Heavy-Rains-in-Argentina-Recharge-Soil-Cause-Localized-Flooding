Heavy Rains in Argentina Recharge Soil, cause Localized Flooding
<p>
	<b>Argentina Soybeans</b> - It's hard to believe, but now there is a concern about flooding once again in Argentina.  Weekend rains in some areas such as northern Buenos Aires and central Santa Fe were as much as 8 inches.  Flooding in localized areas could complicate planting and may result in the need to replant some crops.

<p>
	Farmers in Argentina planted 9% of their soybeans last week and the crop is now 76% planted, which is a little ahead of the five-year average.  In the core production regions, the soybeans are about 95% planted.  In most of the southern locations, the soybeans are 70% to 80% planted, while in far northern Argentina, the soybeans are 25% to 35% planted.

The recent rains have replenished the soil moisture in extensive areas of the country.  The one areas that still needs additional moisture is southern Buenos Aires especially since recent temperatures have been as high as 35&#176C (95&#176F).  The driest area of Argentina is southern Buenos Aires where farmers are at least 20% behind in their soybean planting.  The planting window for double crop soybeans in southeastern Buenos Aires will close about January 10th and more rain will be needed over next several weeks or some of the double crop soybeans may not get planted.

The planting window for soybeans in northern Argentina is now open and most locations have enough soil moisture to start planting.   More rain will be needed though because temperatures have started to heat up in northern Argentina.

	<b>Argentina Corn</b> - The rains over the last ten days have helped to recharge the soil moisture which is especially beneficial for the earlier planted corn that is now in its reproductive phase.  Of the corn that is already planted, the soil moisture late last week was rated approximately 30% average and 70% optimum.  After the weekend rains, there is now excessive moisture and localized flooding in parts of central Argentina.

In the flooded areas the concern now is that crops will need to be replanted and it may be difficult to plant all the intended acreage if the saturated conditions persist into January.

Where the rainfall was not excessive, the additional moisture has also helped the second phase of corn planting.  Farmers planted about 6% of their corn last week and the Argentine corn crop is now about 63% planted, which is slightly ahead of the 5-year average.  I think the recent moisture has stabilized the situation in most of Argentina, but more rainfall is still needed though in southern Buenos Aires province and in parts of Cordoba.
