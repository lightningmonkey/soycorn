2015/16 Soybean Crop in Brazil 2-3% Planted
<p>
	The 2015/16 Brazilian soybean crop is 2-3% planted, which is about average for this time of the year.  The weather this past week in Brazil was generally wet in southern Brazil with scattered showers in the center-west region of the country including Mato Grosso.

<p>
<b>Mato Grosso</b> - The state of Mato Grosso is generally where the first soybeans are planted in Brazil, but dry weather in the state this year has led to a cautious start to the 2015/16 planting season.  According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), 1.6% of the soybeans had been planted in the state by October 1st compared to 4.5% planted last year at this time. AgRural is a little more optimistic and they estimate that 2% of the state's soybeans have been planted compared to 5% last year.

In northern Mato Grosso only a few fields have been planted and most of them are under center pivot irrigation where farmers will plant a second crop of cotton after the soybeans are harvested.  The rainfall in this region of the state has not been heavy enough to insure adequate germination and stand establishment.  The forecast looks more promising and farmers in the region are hoping to start planting by October 10th.

	The situation in western Mato Grosso is similar to that of the northern regions with most of the early planting occurring where center pivot irrigation is available.
</p>

	Southern Mato Grosso has received the most rainfall thus far and farmers are planting in the municipalities of Campo Verde, Rondonopolis, and Serra da Petrovina.  Even in this region, farmers are cautious because they do not want to risk having to replant any of their soybeans due to a return of hot and dry conditions.
</p>
<p>
	The slowest area in the state for early planting is the eastern region where it is still hot and dry and very little rainfall has occurred.  As in the other areas of the state, farmers are hoping to start planting October 10th to October 15th, which would be about a week later than last year.
</p>
<p>
	There were a few scattered showers in Mato Grosso over the weekend with greater chances of showers later this week.  Many farmers in Mato Grosso are planning to start planting their soybeans between October 10th to October 15th, which would be about a week later than last year.  The slower start should not impact the yield potential of the crop if the weather cooperates during the growing season.  Mato Grosso is the largest producer of soybeans and corn in Brazil responsible for 31% and 42% of the nationwide production respectively.

	<b>Parana</b> - The weather in Parana over the weekend was very wet with prolonged periods of shower activity.  By the end of last week, the Department of Rural Economics in the state reported that 13% of the soybeans had been planted compared to 9% last year at this time.  AgRural estimates that 16% of the soybeans in the state have been planted.  The most advanced planting pace is in the western part of the state near the cities of Cascavel and Toledo where planting is approaching 50% complete.
