2018/19 Planting Weather could be Irregular in Mato Grosso
<p>
	Farmers in Mato Grosso will be allowed to start planting their 2018/19 soybeans on September 15th, which is the end of the soybean-free period in the state.  With only two and a half week to go before planting, meterologists in Brazil are releasing their predictions for the upcoming growing season.

	Meterologists Vitor Hassan from the weather forecasting firm Climatempo recently presented his forecast for the upcoming growing season at "The Hour of Planting 2018" event held at the Mato Grosso Foundation for Agriculture and Livestock Research (Fundacao MT).  In his presentation, he indicated the 2018/19 growing season will be influenced by the developing El Nino in the Pacific Ocean.

	He indicated that an El Nino generally results in different weather patterns in Mato Grosso compared to last season's La Nina.

He is forecasting a period of irregular rainfall during October and November with below normal rainfall for the entire state.  For December, January, and February, he is forecasting above normal rainfall in western Mato Grosso, normal rainfall for central Mato Grosso and below normal rainfall for eastern Mato Grosso.  By extension, the dryer forecast for eastern Mato Grosso might also extend into the states of Goias and Tocantins.

Irregular rainfall during planting could be a problem for crop establishment.  Generally, farmers in Mato Grosso like to wait to plant their soybeans until they receive 2-3 inches of rainfall in order to insure adequate germination and stand establishment.
</p>
<p>
Farmers in Mato Grosso are always cautious about planting their soybeans immediately after the first rain of the summer because temperatures in Mato Grosso during planting can be the hottest of the year.  If there is a significant delay between the first rain and the second rain, the young seedlings can quickly succumb to the hot and dry conditions forcing farmers to replant.
