U.S. Crop Conditions Decline due to Wetness
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. corn crop declined 1% last week to 73% good to excellent.  Ten states indicated that the corn condition had improved last week and 6 states indicated that the corn condition had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the western Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are: Wisconsin, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Tennessee.  The five states with the lowest rated corn are: Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, and North Dakota.

	The warm and humid conditions last week were good growing conditions for corn if the area wasn't too wet.  The problem of course are the areas where the soil is saturated or if there is standing water.  The current corn crop is rated a little lower than last year, but better than the long term average.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. soybean crop declined 2% last week to 67% good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week and 9 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the western and southern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are: Wisconsin, Iowa, Kentucky, North Dakota, and a tie between Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota.  The five states with the lowest rated soybeans are: Missouri, Kansas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and North Carolina.

	The soybeans are still very small and small soybeans generally don't like "wet feet" so that is why the soybeans are not doing quite as well as the corn crop.  The soybeans are not as good as last year and only slightly better than the long term average.  In addition to the saturated conditions, I think another concern for the soybeans right now is the acreage and if farmers will be able to plant all their intended soybeans.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's topsoil got wetter last week.  Nine states indicated that the soils got wetter last week while 7 states indicated that the soils got dryer last week.  The states that got wetter were found mostly in the central and eastern Corn Belt while the states that god dryer were found mostly in the southern and western Corn Belt.  The five states with the wettest soils are: Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa.  The five states with the driest soils are: North Carolina, South Dakota, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas.

	Repeated rains continue to fall across generally the same areas of the southwestern and central Corn Belt keeping the nation's topsoil wetter than both last year and the long term average.  They are getting too much of a good thing especially in southwestern and central Corn Belt.
