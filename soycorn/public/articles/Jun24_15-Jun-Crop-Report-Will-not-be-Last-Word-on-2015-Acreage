June Crop Report will not be "Last Word" on 2015 Acreage
<p>
	The survey for the June Planted Report was conducted during the first two weeks of June and unfortunately it is going to contain some intensions instead of actual planted acres.  Whenever planting is delayed such as this year, the survey for the June Planted Report fails to capture the eventual planted acreage.  That will be the case again this year especially for the soybeans.

	When the acreage numbers are released on June 30th, they will probably overestimate the actual planted acreage because they will still contain some acres farmers intend to plant, but never were planted.  I think that will especially be true for the soybeans.  The corn acreage estimate should be more accurate, but it still might overestimate the final corn planted acreage.

Whenever planting delays occur, NASS has the option of conducting a special acreage resurvey to be included in the August Crop Report.  It is unknown at this time if that will be the case this year, but I think there is a good probability they will want to resurvey some of the states.
