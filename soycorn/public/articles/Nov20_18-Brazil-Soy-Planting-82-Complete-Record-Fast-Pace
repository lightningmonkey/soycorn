Brazil Soy Planting 82% Complete - Record Fast Pace
<p>
The weather in Brazil remains favorable for planting and crop development.  The forecast is calling for heavier rainfall in eastern and northeastern Brazil, which may delay the last soybean planting in the region, but barring some unforeseen weather, the soybeans should be able to be planted within the ideal window.

The soybean crop in Brazil is 82% planted nationwide, which is up 11% for the week and continues to be a record fast planting pace.  Last year the planting was 73% and the 5-year average is 67%.  The soybean planting is essentially complete in Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Sao Paulo.  In the state of Parana, the soybean planting is 89% complete.  In Parana, the soybeans are 88% planted and the soybeans are rated 2% average and 98% good.  The soybeans in Parana are 81% in vegetative development, 6% flowering, and 1% filling pods.

Soybean planting in Mato Grosso is essentially complete at 99.3%, which is record fast and about two weeks ahead of average.

The early soybean harvest in Brazil should start within approximately 30 days, or before Christmas.  This would be a record early start to the Brazilian soybean harvest.  What might delay the start would be heavy rains that could keep the combines out of the field. Barring some unforeseen circumstance, the soybean exports from Brazil should also start record early.  The first exports of new crop soybeans might start by mid-January, but that will depend on the weather.
