2020/21 Argentina Soybeans Rated 15% Good/Excellent
<p>
	Recent rainfall has been limited in Argentina with temperatures in the upper 80s to lower 90s.  The forecast for this week has any potential rainfall mostly limited to the western and northern areas with temperatures warming up to widespread 90s by the weekend.

<p>
	This is not a good forecast for Argentina where the crops are about the equivalent of mid-August here in the U.S.  Any potential impact from adverse weather will not be felt equally across the country.  The crops in the core production areas will perform better than the outlying areas.  The crops planted early, both corn and soybeans, will probably yield better than the later planted crops.

	We have mentioned many times that the soils in Argentina have a very good water holding capacity, but if the rainfall continues to be limited and the temperatures start to warm up, moisture stresses will eventually start to develop.  Given the current forecast, there could be problems on the horizon for the soybeans.
</p>
<p>
	The early planted soybeans are about 75% setting pods and 25% filling pods.  In the core production areas, the crop is a little more advanced with 50% filling pods.  The later planted soybeans are 70% flowering and 20% setting pods.
</p>
<p>
	The soybean crop was rated 15% poor to very poor, 70% fair, and 15% good/excellent as of late last week.  The good/excellent percentage compares to 19% last week and 64% last year.  The soil moisture for the soybeans was rated 26% short to very short and 74% favorable to optimum.  The favorable to optimum percentage compares to 79% last week and 96% last year.
