First Good Rains of 2017/18 Growing Season Recorded in Brazil
<p>
The first significant rains of the 2017/18 growing season fell across central and southern Brazil late last week and over the weekend.  Another period of rainfall is expected Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday of this week before dryer weather returns.  After the next few days, the next chance of rain is forecasted for October 15th.

	The rains thus far have been heavier in southern Brazil and some of the storms were accompanied by hail and high winds.  Amounts of 1-2 inches were recorded in various regions of southern Brazil and they are expected to receive more rain over the next few days.

	Rainfall amounts from this weather system were lighter in central Brazil including Mato Grosso, but some important soybean producing regions of Mato Grosso, Goias, and Minas Gerais did receive good rains although the coverage was limited.  Since late last week, some important areas of central Mato Grosso have received over two inches of rain while other areas of the state missed out on the rain, at least thus far.  There are additional chances for rain in central Brazil over the next few days.
