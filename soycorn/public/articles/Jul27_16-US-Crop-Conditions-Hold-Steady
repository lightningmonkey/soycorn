U.S. Crop Conditions Hold Steady
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2016 U.S. corn crop held steady last week at 76% rated good to excellent.  Six states indicated that the corn condition had improved, 10 states indicated that the corn condition had declined, and 2 states indicated no change.  Most of the improvements were found in the central Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern and western Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are:  Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska.  The five lowest rated corn states are:  Michigan, South Dakota, Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania.

	The temperatures did not quite get as high as predicted in many areas, but there ended up being more rainfall than what had been predicted.  The rainfall was not light shower, but heavy downpours which are going to go a long way to sustaining the crop into August.  The corn condition continues to be better than last year and certainly better than the long term average.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2016 U.S. soybean crop held steady last week at 71% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week, 10 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined, and 1 state indicated no change.  Most of the improvements were found in the central Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern and western Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are: Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Illinois. The five lowest rated soybean states are: Mississippi, Kansas, Kansas, Michigan, and South Dakota.

	The soybean crop also continues to be better than last year and certainly better than the long term average.  The recent rains will allow much of the soybean crop to go into August in very good condition.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soils dried out slightly last week with 4 states indicating that the topsoil moisture improved last week and 14 states indicating that the topsoil moisture had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the north-central Corn Belt while most of the declines were found everywhere else.  The five states with the best soil moisture are:  Minnesota, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Illinois, and North Dakota.  The five states with the lowest soil moisture are: Arkansas, Ohio, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Michigan.

	The heat dome situated over the southwestern Midwest resulted in a "ring of fire" of rains along the northern and eastern edge of the heat.  Repeated rains from North Dakota through Minnesota. Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan have helped to mitigate many of the potential adverse impacts of the excessive heat.  The dry areas are now in the far eastern and far western Corn Belt.
