U.S. Corn Condition Declines Slightly, Soybeans Unchanged	
<p>
<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2018 U.S. corn crop declined 1% last week to 75% rated good to excellent.  Five states indicated that the corn condition improved last week, 11 states indicated that the corn condition declined last week, and 2 were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the northwestern Corn Belt, while most of the declines were found in the central and southern Corn Belt.  The five highest rated corn states are:  Wisconsin, Tennessee, Illinois, Ohio, and Nebraska.  The five lowest rated corn states are: Texas, North Carolina, Missouri, Kansas, and a tie between Michigan and Colorado.

	Even though the corn condition declined last week, it is still rated as a very good crop.  The most important thing going forward will be if there will be adequate rainfall to help mitigate the potential impact from ongoing hotter than normal temperatures.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2018 U.S. soybean crop was unchanged last week at 71% rated good to excellent.  Five states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week, 12 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week, and 1 was unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the northwestern Corn Belt and the Delta, while most of the declines were found in the central Corn Belt.  The five highest rated soybean states are:  Wisconsin, Tennessee, Nebraska, Kentucky, and a tie between Minnesota and Ohio.  The five lowest rated soybean states are: Missouri, North Carolina, Kansas, Louisiana, and Michigan.

	Even though the percentage of the crop rated good to excellent held steady, my crop rating declined slightly because of a 1% increase in the very poor category.  My concern for the soybean crop is if the weather dries out somewhat before the crop enters its critical pod filling period at the end of July and into early August.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture declined last week with 2 states indicating that the soil moisture improved (Louisiana and North Dakota) and 16 states indicating that the soil moisture declined.  Most of the improvements were found in the far northern and southern locations, while most of the declines were found across the Corn Belt.  The five states with the highest soil moisture are: Minnesota, Iowa, Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky.  The five states with the driest soils are:  Missouri, Arkansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Kansas.
</p>
<p>
	With the decline in soil moisture last week, the nation's soil moisture is now a little better than average for this time of the year.  The forecast looks dryer going forward, so the soil moisture should continue to decline this week.  The continued forecast of hotter than normal temperatures as the potential for a quick draw down of the soil moisture.
