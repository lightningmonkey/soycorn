	The agricultural sector continues to be the bright spot in an overall dismal Brazilian economy.  While the Brazilian economy struggles with high unemployment, high inflation, and increasing deficits, the decline in the value of the Brazilian currency has spurred record levels of agricultural exports.

According to the Minister of Agriculture, the agricultural sector turned in a balance of trade surplus of US$ 7.183 billion during the month of March.  Agricultural exports totaled US$ 8.347 billion for the month, which was an increase of 11% compared to March of 2015, while imports totaled US$ 1.164 billion.
