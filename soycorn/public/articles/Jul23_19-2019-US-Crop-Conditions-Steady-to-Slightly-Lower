Eight states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week while 8 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week and two states were unchanged.

	The soybeans as well as the corn continue to be very delayed in their development, which poses a risk from frost on the back-end.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's topsoil continued to dry out last week with 8 states indicating improved soil moisture and 9 states indicating declining soil moisture with 1 state unchanged.  Most of the improved conditions were found in the western and northern Corn Belt while most of the dryer conditions were found in the eastern Corn Belt and the Delta.  The five wettest states are:  Mississippi, Louisiana, Minnesota, South Dakota, and a tie between Wisconsin and Kansas.  The five driest states are:  Indiana, North Carolina, Illinois, Iowa, and Michigan.

	The rainfall last week was generally more than what had been forecasted.  Even with the better than expected rains, the soil moisture continued to dry out.  The forecast for this week is calling for seasonal temperatures with limited rainfall.  If the forecast verifies, the soil moisture should continue to decline in next week's report.
