	The total Brazilian corn production is now down 16.4 million tons (-16.8%) from last year's production of 97.8 million tons.  The decline this month was due to a smaller safrinha corn production.  The safrinha corn production is now estimated at 54.5 million tons, which is down 12.8 million tons (-19%) from last year's production of 67.3 million.
