Brazil's Safrinha Corn 2% Harvested
<p>
The weather over the last several weeks has probably stabilized the safrinha corn crop in southern Brazil.  There has been three episodes of rain over the last three weeks and the crop has dodged two episodes of scattered frosts/freezes.  The biggest threat going forward will be the possibility of additional frosts.  The safrinha corn harvest is just getting started, so we don't have any good yield reports as yet, but there should be more yield estimates coming in over the next 1-2 weeks.

	<b>Mato Grosso</b> - According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural economics (Imea), the safrinha corn in Mato Grosso is 1.5% harvested, which is a little slower than last year.  The corn harvest is most advanced in the mid-north region at 2.2%.  Imea estimates that the safrinha corn acreage increased 7% this year, but the yields will be down about 6% compared to last year.  Farmers in the state have sold 82% of their anticipated corn production and approximately 30% of their anticipated 2020/21 corn production.

	<b>Parana</b> - According to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral), the safrinha corn in Parana is 2% harvested with 5% in vegetative development, 28% pollinating, 56% filling grain, and 11% mature.  The safrinha corn is rated 16% poor, 43% average, and 41% good.  The percent of the crop rated good continues to decline on a weekly basis.

	The safrinha corn harvest will pick up speed in about 10-15 days especially in the western part of the state.  The full-season corn in Parana is completely harvested, but farmers have been reluctant to sell their corn in the hope of higher prices.  Corn in Parana is currently selling for about R$ 42.00 per sack (approximately $3.80 per bushel), which is high enough to cover the cost of production and generate a good profit.

	</b>Mato Grosso do Sul</b> - In the municipality of Dourandina, which is located in southern Mato Grosso do Sul, farmers are hoping that their corn can survive the month of June without a frost/freeze.  The recent rains have been good enough to insure enough soil moisture to finish the crop, but it was planted late and it will need to stay frost free until the end of June.  The corn harvest will start at the end of June and gain force during July.
