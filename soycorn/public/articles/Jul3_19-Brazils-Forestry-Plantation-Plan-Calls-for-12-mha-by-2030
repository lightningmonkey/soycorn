Brazil's Forestry Plantation Plan calls for 12 mha by 2030
<p>
In addition to the continued expansion of row crop acreage in Brazil, the Brazilian government also has plans to increase forestry plantations by 2 million hectares by 2030.
</p>
<p>
The National Plan for the Development of Forestry Plantations ((PNDF), which was originally proposed in December of 2014, was approved by the Ministry of Agriculture on June 5, 2019.  The plan deals with production, processing, commercialization of wood and sub-products, services, and inputs related to forestry plantations.
</p>
<p>
Currently, there are 10 million hectares of forestry plantations in Brazil and the goal is to increase that to 12 million hectares by 2030.  Brazil is already the world leader in forestry productivity with 35.7 cubic meters/hectare/year for eucalyptus plantations and 30.5 cubic meters/hectare/year for pine plantations.  These values are approximately two times higher than forestry plantations in the Northern Hemisphere.
</p>
<p>
The objectives of the PNDF plan include:  increase the production and productivity of forestry plantations, promote utilization of forestry products, decrease pressure on native forests, increase income and quality of life for small rural producers, and meditate effects of climate change.
</p>
<p>
The PNDF plan also has technical objectivists such as:  improved forestry sanitation, invest in research and innovation in forestry production, simplify environmental licensing, and improve infrastructure associated with forestry production.
</p>
<p>
An assessment of the plan's success is scheduled on March 21st of 2020, 2025, and 2030, which is the International Day of the Forest.
