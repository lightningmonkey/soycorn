	Beneficial rains fell over the weekend across many of the dryer areas of the eastern Corn Belt.  The western half of Iowa unfortunately missed out on the rains, but the cooler temperatures this week should limit the moisture stress in areas that missed out on the recent rains.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's topsoil moisture improved last week with 10 states indicating improved moisture while 8 states indicated lower soil moisture.  Most of the improvements were found in the eastern and western areas while most of the declines were found in the northern Corn Belt.

	Recent rains have improved the soil moisture in some of the previously dry areas of the eastern Corn Belt.  Continued dryness though remains a concern in the western half of Iowa.  The near term forecast is for a cool and generally dry week across the northwestern Corn Belt.  A short period of cool and dry weather is not a major concern, but the region will need additional moisture as soon as the temperatures warm up once again.
