Wheat Harvest reaches 16% in Parana in Southern Brazil
<p>
	As farmers in southern Brazil prepare to start planting their 2017/18 summer crops, they are also in the process of harvesting their winter wheat crop.  The Department of Rural Economics for the state of Parana (Deral) is reporting that farmers in the state have harvested 16% of their winter wheat crop.

	The planting and development of the wheat crop in Parana, which is Brazil's largest wheat producing state, is very spread out.  As an illustration, 9% of the wheat is still in vegetative development, 16% is flowering, 25% is in grain filling, and 50% is maturing.  All the wheat in the state will be followed by a second crop of soybeans once the wheat is harvested.

Of the remaining wheat, 49% is rated in good to excellent condition, 33% is rated in average condition, and 18% is rated in poor condition.  A frost earlier in the growing season adversely impacted the crop especially the early planted wheat that was flowering when the cold weather hit.  As a result, production estimates have been declining.  The consulting firm Trigo & Farinhas is estimating that Parana will produce 2.59 million tons of wheat.  Conab is estimating that the state will produce 2.48 million tons.  During the 2015/16 growing season, the state of Parana produced 3.41 million tons of wheat.
