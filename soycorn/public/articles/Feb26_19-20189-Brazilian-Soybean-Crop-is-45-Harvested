2018/19 Brazilian Soybean Crop is 45% Harvested
<p>
The weather last week was generally wet across central Brazil, but dryer across southern Brazil.  The forecast for this week is calling for more rain cross central Brazil and increased chances of rain in southern Brazil.  The improved rains of the last several weeks have stabilized the soybean crop and even improved the yield prospects for some of the later maturing soybeans.

<p>
	The rains were welcomed in the two areas where the soybeans could still be helped, which are Rio Grande do Sul and in northeastern Brazil.  If the weather remains beneficial in those two regions, my soybean estimate could increase 1-2 million tons before it is all said and done.

<p>
	According to AgRural, the Brazilian soybean crop is 45% harvested compared to 25% last year and 27% for the 5-year average.  This represents an advance of 9% for the week.  The harvest pace in Brazil has slowed down a little over the last two weeks due to wetter weather.  There are reports of some high moisture soybeans (22% to 25%) but as of yet, there have not been any reports of poor quality soybeans due to the wetness.

<p>
<b>Mato Grosso</b> - The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported on Friday that 80% of the soybeans had been harvested compared to approximately 58% for both last year and the 5-year average.  This represents an advance of 11% for the week.  The fastest harvest is in the western part of the state where 91% of the soybeans have been harvested.  The slowest harvest pace is in northeastern Mato Grosso where 58% of the soybeans have been harvested,

<b>Parana</b> - AgRural estimated that 45% of the soybeans in Parana had been harvested.  The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) lowered their estimate of the state's soybean crop to 16.35 million tons, which is now down 15% from last year.  Deral reported that 42% of the soybeans had been harvested and that the remaining soybeans are rated 5% poor, 28% average, and 67% good.

<p>
<b>Rio Grande do Sul</b> - Emater-RS reported that 5% of the soybeans had been harvested or are ready for harvest with 72% of the crop filling pods.  The weather last week and over the weekend in Rio Grande do Sul was generally favorable for the late maturing soybeans and there is more rain in the forecast for later this week.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mato Grosso do Sul</b> - The soybean harvest in the state is approximately 57% complete and the soybean yields vary from 20 to 65 sacks per hectare (18 to 58 bu/ac) with a statewide average estimated at 50 to 53 sacks per hectare (44 to 47 bu/ac).
</p>
<p>
In the municipality of Iguatemi, which is located in southern Mato Grosso do Sul, farmers have harvested approximately 50% of the soybeans and they are reporting yields of 41 to 45 sacks per hectare (36 to 40 bu/ac).  Yields are down about 35% from last year because this region was one of the hardest hit areas by the hot and dry conditions during December and January.

<p>
<b>Goias</b> - The soybeans in Goias are 67% harvested.
