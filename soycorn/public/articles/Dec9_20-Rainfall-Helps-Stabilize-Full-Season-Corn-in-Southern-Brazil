Rainfall Helps Stabilize Full-Season Corn in Southern Brazil
<p>
The rainfall last week and over the weekend in southern Brazil was very beneficial for the later planted full-season corn.  It came too late for corn that was planted in late August or early September.  I think the rains helped to stabilize the full-season corn, so I left the Brazilian corn estimate unchanged this week at 104.0 million tons.  The full-season corn only accounts for about one-fourth of Brazil's corn production with the safrinha crop accounting for about three-fourths of the production.
