2020/21 Brazil Soybeans 46% Harvested vs. 59% Last Year
<p>
	The weather in Brazil last week was more of the same - wet across the more northern areas and dryer across southern Brazil.  The forecast is calling for some moderation in both areas of Brazil.  The rainfall across the northern areas is not expected to be as heavy as it has been in recent weeks.  Far southern Brazil is forecasted to receive some rain, which is good news for the soybeans filling pods in the Rio Grande do Sul.

	The Brazil soybeans were 46% harvested late last week compared to 59% last year according to AgRural.  This represents an advance of 11% for the week.

	<b>Mato Grosso Soybeans</b> - Farmers in Mato Grosso had harvested 80% of their soybeans as of late last week compared to 97% last year and 88% average according to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea).  The most advanced harvest is in the western part of the state where 90% of the soybeans have been harvested.  The slowest harvest is in the south-central part of the state where 65% of the soybeans have been harvested (32% slower than last year).

	In their March Crop Report, Conab estimated that the soybean acreage in Mato Grosso increased 2.7% compared to last year to 10.2 million hectares (25.1 million acres), but the production will be down 0.6% compared to last year to 35.6 million tons.  The reason for the lower production is a 3.2% reduction in yields compared to last year to 3,473 kg/ha (51.7 bu/ac).

	<b>Parana Soybeans</b> - The soybean crop in Parana was 39% harvest as of late last week compared to 70% last year according to Safras & Mercado.  Scientists in Parana have indicated that corn leafhoppers (Dalbulus maidis) are a serious problem this year.  These insects are the main vector of the MRFV virus, which is one of the most important virus that affect corn. The infestation started with the full-season corn and it is extending into the safrinha corn.  Some producers have already applied up to 10 insecticide applications sine they planted their corn back in September.

	<b>Rio Grande do Sul Soybeans</b> - A few early fields of soybeans have been harvested in the state with 1% of the crop now harvested.  Another 19% of the soybeans are approaching maturity and 66% are filling pods.  Rains during the first week of March benefited the soybeans that were filling pods.
