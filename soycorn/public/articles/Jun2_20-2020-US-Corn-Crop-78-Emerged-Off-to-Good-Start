2020 U.S. Corn Crop 78% Emerged, Off to Good Start
<p>
The 2020 U.S. corn crop is 93% planted compared to 64% last year and 89% average.  The corn is 78% emerged compared to 42% last year and 73% average.

	The weather last week was generally OK with maybe too much rain in some areas.  The weather this week is going to be warmer and dryer, which should be beneficial for both the corn and soybean crops by encouraging emergence and rapid early growth.
</p>
<p>
	The crop got off to a faster start in the western Corn Belt especially in Iowa where the corn is 93% emerged (81% average) and in Minnesota where it is 91% emerged (79% average). It has been slower in the eastern Corn Belt with Ohio 55% emerged (59% average), Michigan 53% (51% average), and Indiana 73% (63% average).

There are always some problem areas in the country and this year it appears to be in the northwestern Corn Belt and parts of the South and the Southeastern U.S.  The corn planting continues to be delayed in North Dakota where 75% of the corn has been planted (90% average).  Farmers in North Dakota were projected to plant 3,200,000 acres of corn in 2020.

<p>
We are already passed the prevent plant dates in North Dakota and there is still 25% of the corn that has not been planted (800,000 acres), so I am going to estimate that 1.0 to 1.5 million acres of intended corn will not be planted in North Dakota, South Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.
</p>
<p>
There will also probably be some corn in the eastern and southern areas that will need to be replanted due to saturated conditions or be claimed as failed acres.
</p>
<p>
I am currently estimating that the 2020 U.S. corn acreage will be in the range of 94 to 95 million acres and at this point, I think the corn yields will be trend line or a little higher.  Therefore, I would estimate the 2020 U.S. corn yield in the range of 179.0 to 180.0 bu/ac.
