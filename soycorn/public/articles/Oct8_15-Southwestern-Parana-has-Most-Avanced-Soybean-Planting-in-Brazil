Southwestern Parana has most Advanced Soybean Planting in Brazil
<p>
	The state of Parana is the most advanced state in Brazil for soybean planting this year and the southwestern region of state is the part of the state where the planting is the most advanced.  According to Josemar Banach Fonseca from the Department of Rural Economics (Deral), in southwestern Parana approximately 35% of the soybeans have been planted with 95% of the full-season corn and 50% of the dry beans planted.

The spring rainfall has not fallen uniformly across the region and in a few of the local municipalities the soybeans are 85% planted, while in a few others, the crop is just 10% planted.  The ideal time to plant soybeans in southwestern Parana is from September 15th until the end of October.

	Farmers in southwestern Parana are expected to reduce their full-season corn acreage by 30% as they opt to plant the more profitable soybeans.  In recent years farmers in the region have reduced their corn acreage in favor of more soybeans.  They realize that the lack of crop rotations is not good for the long term health of the soil, but short term financial considerations have convinced farmers to rely more heavily on soybeans.
