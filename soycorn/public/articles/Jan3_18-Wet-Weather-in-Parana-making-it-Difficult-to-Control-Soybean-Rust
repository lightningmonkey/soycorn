Wet Weather in Parana making it difficult to control Soybean Rust
<p>
	Brazilian farmers are always worried about their ability to control soybean rust because it is such a devastating soybean disease.  Embrapa reported last week that there have been 53 confirmed cases of soybean rust in Brazil and that 34 of those cases awere in the state of Parana or about 65% of the total.

	The problem in Parana is that it has been very wet recently, which has made it difficult to apply the fungicides needed to keep the disease in check.  The vice-president of Aprosoja PR (the Soybean and Corn Producers Association of Parana) in a recent interview with Noticias Agricolas, indicated that the state has received rainfall over 20 straight days which has not allowed farmers an opportunity to apply their needed fungicides. Embrapa is recommending that farmers reapply their fungicides every two weeks once the disease has been confirmed in their area.

	The soybean planting in the state started 20-25 days later than normal last fall due to dry conditions.  The soybean harvest in the state is expected to start about the third week of February, so there is still a long time that the farmers need to keep the rust under control.

The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) is estimating that Parana will produce 19 million tons of soybeans, but the vice president of Aprosoja is not as optimistic and he feels the soybean production in Parana will be closer to 17 million tons.
