Cotton Planting Underway in Mato Grosso
<p>
	Mato Grosso is the largest cotton producing state in Brazil and farmers in the state have started to plant their 2016/17 cotton crop.  According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), farmers in the state have planted 1.5% of their intended cotton crop, which is about half the early planting pace compared to last growing season.  Planting in the southeastern part of the state is the most advanced with approximately 4% of the crop planted.

	Only a small percentage of the cotton produced in the state is full-season cotton, which is planted in December.  Over 80% of the cotton in the state is planted as a second crop after the soybeans are harvested.  The ideal planting window for the safrinha cotton usually closes by the end of January.  Since the soybeans in the state were planted very early this year, there should be ample opportunity for the farmers in the state to plant their safrinha cotton before the end of January.

	The one thing that could delay the planting would be heavy rains during January, which is the peak of the rainy season in central Brazil.  Heavy rains could delay the soybean harvest, which in turn could delay the cotton planting.
