2017 U.S. Corn 91% Planted, 65% Rated Good to Excellent
<p>
	The 2017 U.S. corn crop is now 91% planted compared to 93% last year and 93% average.  Corn planting in the western Corn Belt is a little ahead of the average while the corn planting in the eastern Corn Belt is a little behind the average.  Of the major production states, Iowa and Minnesota are the most advanced with 97% and 96% planted respectively.
</p>

Planting in the eastern Corn Belt has been slowed by persistent wetness.  It is particularly slow in Indiana with 81% planted (average is 90%) and Ohio at 82% planted (average is 88%).  The nationwide corn emergence is 73% compared to 75% last year and 75% average.

<p>
There is approximately eight million acres of corn left to plant and the remaining corn will be planted post the ideal planting window.  Corn planted from this point forward would probably have a lower yield potential compared to corn planted in early May.

The first crop rating of the season rated the corn crop at 1% very poor, 3% poor, 24% fair, 57% good, and 8% excellent.  The 65% good to excellent rating is below the first rating in 2016 when 72% of the corn was rated good to excellent and in 2015 when the first rating was 74% good to excellent.  The lowest corn rating are found in the eastern Corn Belt with Indiana rated 43% good to excellent, Ohio rated 49% good to excellent, and Illinois rated 52% good to excellent.

<p>
The first crop rating of the season has a poor correlation with final yield, but it is safe to say that it would be very difficult to achieve a record corn yield with this type of first crop rating.

The soybean crop is 67% planted compared to 71% last year and 68% average.  The soybean emergence is slow at 37% compared to 42% last year and 40% average.  The first soybean crop rating will be issued on June 12th.
