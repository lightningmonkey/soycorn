	The corn rating improved slightly because of the recent rains, but more moisture is needed especially in the northwestern corn Belt.  The corn has slowed down a little in its development probably due to the recent cool temperatures.  The silking percentage is behind average, and the percent dough is average.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture improved last week with 14 states indicating improved soil moisture last week while 4 states indicated lower soil moisture.

<p>
	The area where more rainfall is needed continues to be the northwestern Corn Belt where South Dakota is rated 82% short on moisture, Minnesota is 76% short, North Dakota is 75% short, and Iowa is 40% short.  The rainfall this past weekend was disappointing in the northwestern Corn Belt and the area can ill afford to miss any chance of rain especially as the temperatures warm up.
