Report Concerning Cost of Production in North & South America
<p>
	The Economic Research Service of the USDA published an excellent report on June 20th comparing the cost of producing soybeans and corn in the United States, Brazil, and Argentina.  It is Economic Information Bulletin number 154 and it is titled "Corn and Soybean Production Costs and Export Competitiveness in Argentina, Brazil, and the United States.  You can find the report at the following link:  <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/eib-economic-information-bulletin/eib-154.aspx">Corn and Soybean Production Costs and Export Competitiveness in Argentina, Brazil, and the United States.</a>

	I am frequently asked what it costs to produce soybeans or corn in South America and it is a hard question to answer because of the different land costs, transportation issues, and currency fluctuations.  I think this report does a good job looking at all those issues.  They also have good maps showing the various production regions in all three countries, factors affecting the cost of transportation and the export destinations for soybeans and corn produced in South America.
