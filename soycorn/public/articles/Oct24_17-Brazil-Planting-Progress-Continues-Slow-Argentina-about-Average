Brazil Planting Progress Continues Slow, Argentina about Average
<p>
<b>Brazilian Soybeans</b> - The 2017/18 Brazilian soybean crop is approximately 20% planted compared to 29% last year and 19% average according to AgRural.  The nationwide planting percentage is being propelled by the good planting pace in Parana while the planting in Mato Grosso continues to be delayed.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mato Grosso</b> - In Mato Grosso, the soybeans are 25.8% planted according to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea).  This represents an advance of 11.4% for the week, but it is still 16% slower than last year when 42.7% of the crop had been planted.  The five-year average planting pace in the state is 28%.
</p>
<p>
The planting pace is variable across the state with the western areas 60% planted (6% slower than last year) and the northeastern areas 3% planted (5% slower than last year).  Weekend rains helped, but many areas in eastern Mato Grosso only received minimal amounts of rainfall or none at all.  Some of the earlier planted soybeans may have to be replanted due to poor emergence.
</p>
<p>
	A delay in planting soybeans in Mato Grosso is not too much of a concern as long as the weather is acceptable during the remainder of the growing season.  Soybeans in Mato Grosso can be planted until about the third week of November with minimal yield loss if the weather cooperates.  Planting that late though will result in farmers spending more money on additional applications of fungicides to control soybean rust and insecticides to control various pests.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Parana</b> - According to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral), the farmers in Parana had planted 51% of their soybeans as of a week ago.  Estimates are that as much as 70% of the soybeans in the state may be planted as of this writing (Monday).  Areas in western Parana are done planting while planting in northern Parana is somewhat behind the normal pace.  Some areas of western Parana received as much as 4 inches of rainfall over the weekend with more heavy rain in the forecast for this week.  Temperatures are going to be below normal this week, which could slow the initial development of the crop.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Goias</b> - In the state of Goias an estimated 5% of the soybeans have been planted compared to 15% last year.  Dry conditions have kept the planters out of the field.  Some of the earliest planted soybeans may have to be replanted when rainfall arrives,
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mato Grosso do Sul</b> - Soybean planting in Mato Grosso do Sul is 33% complete, which is 3.4% behind last year.  In the northern part of the state, the soybean planting is 13%, with 12% planted in central regions and 45% planted in southern regions.  Some areas of central Mato Grosso do Sul that had been planted earlier may have to be replanted due to dry weather over the last 20-30 days that resulted in less than desired plant populations.
</p>
<p>
          <b>Argentine Soybeans</b> - The weather in Argentina has been OK especially compared to what it had been several months ago.  There are still saturated areas in Argentina, but the typical spring weather has allowed for the saturated areas to continue shrinking.
</p>
<p>
          Soybean planting is just getting underway in Argentina with less than 1% of the crop planted.  Most of the early planting is occurring in the northern core region where farmers are wrapping up their first phase of corn planting.
</p>
<p>
<b>Argentine Corn</b> - The corn planting is moving along at an OK pace and the early condition of the crop is rated as good.  The forecast is calling for generally dryer conditions, which would be good in the short term.  Some longer range forecasts in Argentina are calling for a continued dryer trend, which could be somewhat problematic eventually.
</p>
<p>
The corn in Argentina was 27.7% planted late last week according to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange, which is a little more than last year, but slower than average.  In the core production regions, the corn is 75% to 85% planted with 10% to 30% planted in southern locations and 0% to 12% planted in northern locations.  The most advanced corn is in the 2-5 leaf stage.
