South American could set new Records for Soy and Corn Production
<p>
Below is my first estimates for the current as well as the maximum and minimum crop estimates for South America.  These estimates will certainly change going forward due to the weather and when we get better information concerning the planted acreages.

	If the weather during growing season cooperates, there is the potential for some very big crops coming out of South America early next year.  I currently have the South American soybean crop increasing 21.8 million tons compared to last year (+12.7%) and the corn crop increasing 23.5 million tons compared to last year (+19.8%).  Conab will release their first estimates of the 2018/19 Brazilian crops in their October Crop Report, which will be released Thursday, October 11, 2018.
