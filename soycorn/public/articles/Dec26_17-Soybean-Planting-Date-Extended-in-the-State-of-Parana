Soybean Planting Date Extended in the State of Parana
<p>
The state of Parana tried something a little different this growing season by allowing farmers to start planting their soybeans five days earlier than normal on September 10th.  That did not work out very well because of dry weather during September, which did not allow farmers to plant their summer crops including soybeans.

	The early planting of other crops in the state got delayed as well so that the state is now allowing farmers to plant soybeans until January 14th, compared to the original cutoff date of December 31st.  These later planted soybeans will probably be double cropped after the harvest of dry beans or maybe even after some early planted corn is harvested.  I do not think this extension will increase the overall soybean acreage in the state because farmers had intended to plant a second crop of soybeans after they harvested their dry beans.  The problem is that they did not get their dry beans planted early enough to allow for their soybeans to be planted by December 31st.

	This extension is raising questions concerning the prohibition of safrinha soybean production in the state, which a second crop of soybeans planted after the first crop of soybeans are harvested.  Questions are also being raised concerning the control of soybean rust.  The reason why safrinha soybean production was prohibited in the first place was for the control of soybean rust and now by allowing soybeans to be planted later than originally permitted, it is basically the same as allowing a safrinha soybean crop as far as rust is concerned.
