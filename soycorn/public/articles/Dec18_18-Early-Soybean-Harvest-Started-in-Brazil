Early Soybean Harvest Started in Brazil
<p>
The first reports of soybean harvesting are coming in from the mid-north region of Mato Grosso.  The first harvesting is in the municipality of Nova Ubirata, which is just east of Sorriso in Mato Grosso.  These are 90-day maturity soybeans that were planted on September 15th at the end of the soybean-free period.

	The rains were good when the soybeans were planted and they continued to be good during the entire growth cycle.  Soybean planting in this region started approximately 30 days earlier than last year.

	I expect more harvest report to start coming in from Mato Grosso and also from western Parana.  The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) is estimating that 1-2% of the soybeans in Mato Grosso may be harvested by the end of December and that 15-20% may be harvested by the end of January.
