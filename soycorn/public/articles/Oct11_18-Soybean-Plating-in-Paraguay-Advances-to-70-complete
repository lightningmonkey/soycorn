Soybean Planting in Paraguay advances to 70% Complete
<p>
	Soybean planting is underway all across South America and according to the Paraguayan Grain and Oilseed Exporters Association (Capeco), farmers in Paraguay have planted 70% of their intended 2018/19 soybean crop.

<p>
Planting has evolved in a positive manner in Paraguay with some areas receiving too much rainfall especially in the municipalities of Itapua and Alto Parana in the southeastern part of the country.

<p>
Capeco is expecting farmers in Paraguay to plant 3.5 million hectares of soybeans (8.6 million acres), which would be unchanged from last year.  Paraguay is expected to produce approximately 10 million tons of soybeans in 2018/19.  Soybean production in Paraguay has been slowly increasing in recent years, but the total production in the country comes in at a distant third place in South America behind the projected 120 million tons of production in Brazil and the projected 57 million tons of production in Argentina.

<p>
Paraguay exported approximately 6 million tons of soybeans in 2018 with virturatily all of the soybeans going to crushers in Argentina where a severe drought significantly impacted the 2017/18 soybean production.

Farmers in Paraguay have already planted their full-season corn, which is now in early vegetative development.  The wheat harvest is underway in Paraguay and all of the wheat will be followed by a second crop of soybeans.
