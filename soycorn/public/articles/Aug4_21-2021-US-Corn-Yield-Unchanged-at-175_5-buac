2021 U.S. Corn Yield Unchanged at 175.5 bu/ac
<p>
The 2021 U.S. corn yield was left unchanged this week at 175.5 bu/ac, and I have a neutral bias going forward.

	Over the weekend there were some rains across southern Iowa, northern Missouri, parts of eastern Nebraska and southeastern South Dakota as well as western Illinois.  There was not much rain across Minnesota or North Dakota. The forecast for this week is mostly dry with chances of rain later in the week with cooler temperatures to start the week and warmer temperatures to end the week.  No extreme temperatures are expected this week.  There are improved chances of rain in the 6-10 day forecast.

	The month of July ended up being beneficial for most of the corn in the eastern Corn Belt, but not as beneficial in the western Corn Belt especially in Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota.  I think Iowa is going to be the swing state this year.  The corn in Iowa is currently rated 62% good to excellent.  The soil moisture situation in Iowa is variable with 50% of the soil moisture rated short to very short.  In the northern half of Iowa, the soil moisture is generally 60-70% rated short to very short, whereas in southern Iowa, it is rated 15-20% short to very short.  Given the forecast for this week, the soil moisture will probably decline this week in Iowa as well as in the other states in the western Corn Belt.

	The corn condition declined last week by 2% to 62% rated good and excellent.  The corn is 91% silking compared to 91% last year and 86% average.  The corn is 38% in dough compared to 37% last year and 33% average.

The area of most concern continues to be the northwestern Corn Belt.
