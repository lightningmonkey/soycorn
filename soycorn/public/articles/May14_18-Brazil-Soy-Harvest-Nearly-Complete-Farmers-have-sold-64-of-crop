<p>
	Brazilian farmers have nearly completed harvesting their 2017/18 soybean crop and their full-season corn crop.  According to the consulting firm Datagro, as of May 4th, the Brazilian soybean crop was 98% harvested and the full-season corn crop was 95% harvested.

	According to Flavio Franca Junior from Datagro, Brazilian farmers have taken advantage of the recent domestic price strength to sell 64% of their 2017/18 soybean production.  This is well ahead of the 52% sold last year at this time and slightly above the 5-year average of 62%.  The sales percentage was up 10% over the past month, which is more than the normal 6% increase per month typical for this time of the year.

They are estimating the 2017/18 Brazilian soybean crop at 116.7 million tons, which is a new record high production and up 2% from last year.  The current sales volume is even more impressive when you consider that they have 2% more soybeans to sell compared to last year.

The full-season corn harvest was approximately 95% complete as of May 4th, which is a little slower than last year and the 5-year average.  Brazilian farmers have sold 27% of their full-season corn production compared to 46% last year and 37% for the 5-year average.  They are estimating that the full-season corn production will be 26.0 million tons, which is down 16% compared to last year.
