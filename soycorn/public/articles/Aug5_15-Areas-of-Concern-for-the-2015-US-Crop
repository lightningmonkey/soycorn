Areas of Concern for the 2015 U.S. Crops
<ul>
<li>Ongoing problems of slow development and stunted crops in the eastern Corn Belt associated with the previous saturated conditions, including a loss of nitrogen.</li>
<li>Potential for increased disease pressure.  For corn the potential problems could be from northern corn leaf blight, grey leaf spot, and anthracnose.  For soybeans the potential problems could be from sudden death syndrome and while mold. </li>
<li>Shallow rooted crops in the eastern Corn Belt that could make the crops more susceptible to dry conditions, if they were to develop.  Several eastern states have already reported some moisture stress starting to appear.</li>
<li>Hot and dry conditions across the southern U.S. from the Delta over to North Carolina.</li>
