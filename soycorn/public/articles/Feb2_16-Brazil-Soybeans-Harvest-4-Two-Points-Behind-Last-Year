Brazil Soybean Harvest 4%, Two Points Behind Last Year
<p>
	The Brazilian soybean harvest is 4% complete, which is behind last year when 6% was harvested, but generally in line with the 5-year average.  Below is a state-by-state breakdown of the harvest progress and some of the early yield reports.  This information was obtained from a variety of sources including:  AgRural, SoNoticas, Imea, and Cepea.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mato Grosso</b> - The soybean crop is 8% harvested compared to 11% last year.  The early maturing soybeans in Lucas do Rio Verde, which is located in central Mato Grosso, are averaging 44 sacks per hectare (38 bu/ac).  In Nova Mutum, also in central Mato Grosso, the early yields are in the range of 30-50 sacks per hectare (26 to 43.5 bu/ac).  In Campo Verde in southeastern Mato Grosso, yields are improving after a lower start.  In Campo de Julio, which is located in western Mato Grosso, the rains were good all season and as a result, the yields are averaging 58 sacks per hectare (50 bu/ac).
</p>
<p>
	Statewide, the soybean yields in Mato Grosso are improving as the harvest moves into the later maturing soybeans.  The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) is now estimating the statewide yield at 51.2 sacks per hectare (44.5 bu/ac), which is up from last week's yield of 50.9 sacks per hectare (44.2 bu/ac).
</p>
<p>
	<b>Parana</b> - The soybeans are 9% harvested compared to 11% last year.  In parts of the state 30% of the soybeans are ready for harvest as soon as the weather dries out.  Many farmers are still spraying to control rust on the later maturing soybeans.  In Maringa, which is located in northern part of the state, soybeans are averaging 55 sacks per hectare (47.8 bu/ac).
</p>
<p>
	<b>Goias</b> - The soybeans are 4% harvested, which is in line with last year.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mato Grosso do Sul</b> - The soybeans are 3% harvested, which is in line with last year.  Early yields near the city of Dourados in the southern part of the state are 50 sacks per hectare (43.5 bu/ac)
</p>
<p>
<b>Rio Grande do Sul</b> - Rain fell across the northern part of the state after several weeks of dry weather. The soybeans in northern Rio Grande do Sul are expected to be good, but probably not as good as last year.  Soybeans in the central part of the state still need rain.  Emater/RS estimates that 42% of the soybeans are flowering and 19% are setting pods.  Rainfall over the next few weeks will be critical for the soybeans because the dryer than normal weather during the month of January allowed for a decline in the soil moisture.
</p>
<p>
In Northwestern Rio Grande do Sul where early maturing soybeans were planted early, the crop is approaching maturity and harvest will start in the coming days.  Early yields are expected to be very good in the range of 2,430 to 2,710 kg/ha (35 to 39 bu/ac) compared to the 5-year average of 2,000 kg/ha (29 bu/ac).
</p>
<p>
<b>Sao Paulo</b> - The soybeans are 5% harvested with early yields as high as 56 sacks per hectare (48.7 bu/ac), but the later planted soybeans are expected to pull down the average yield.
</p>
<p>
<b>Minas Gerais</b> - The early harvest is just getting started on the irrigated soybeans and there are concerns about lower seed quality due to the wet weather.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bahia</b> - Most of the soybeans are flowering and setting pods with 20% of the crop filling pods.  The month of January was very wet across the state delaying the end of the planting.
