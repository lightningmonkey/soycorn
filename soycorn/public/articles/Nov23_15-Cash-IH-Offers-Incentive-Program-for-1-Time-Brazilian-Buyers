Cash IH Offers Incentive Program for 1st Time Brazilian Buyers
<p>
	Cash IH is in the midst of a sales promotion for Brazilian farmers who purchase their first Case IH tractor before the end of year.  Since the program was launched in April, they have sold more than 400 units, which represents 50% of the sales in that segment.  The promotion is on several Case IH models Series A from 60 to 130 horsepower and it includes a discount up to R$ 10,000 (US$ 2,650 using the exchange rate of 3.8 reals per dollar) and free parts for the first two revisions to the tractor.  Company officials feel this is a good way to get exposure to farmers in Brazil who had not previously purchased Cash IH tractors.
