2020/21 Argentina Soybeans 7.2% Harvested vs. 37.8% Last Year
<p>
	Rains slowed the soybean harvest last week, but the additional moisture probably helped the late planted soybeans that are still filling pods.  The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange reported that the average soybean yield thus far was 3,600 kg/ha (53.6 bu/ac) with a wide range of 1,900 to 3,390 kg/ha (28.3 to 50.5 bu/ac).  The best yields are being reported from the core production areas.
