<p>
There were a few scattered showers last week across central Brazil with a few isolated areas receiving enough rain to start planting soybeans.  Most farmers in central Brazil will have to wait for additional rainfall before they risk planting their soybeans.

	Hot and dry conditions have taken hold again this week across central Brazil reducing the chances of any significant rains this week.  Temperatures this week across central Brazil are forecasted to peak at 104 to 107 F, which is very hot even for Brazil.  This September will be one of the driest in decades across central Brazil.

	The heaviest rains last week in Mato Grosso fell across the northwestern part of the state and the forecast is that far northwestern Mato Grosso could receive up to 80 mm (3.2 inches) of precipitation over the next 10 days.  There is only limited crop production in far northwestern Mato Grosso, it is more rainforest and cattle production.

The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported that the soil moisture across the state is very short due to the less than normal rainfall that has fallen across the state thus far in 2020.

	The rainfall in southern Brazil has been much better especially in the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina who could receive 60-120 mm (2.4 to 4.8 inches) over the next 10 days.  The rainfall has been less in the state of Parana with most of the rain falling across the southernmost region of the state.  In western and northern Parana, the forecast is for less than 25 mm (1.0 inch) of rain over the next 10 days and very high temperatures.
