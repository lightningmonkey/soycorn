Mato Grosso Safrinha Corn Estimate increased slightly by Imea
<p>
	In their fifth evaluation of the <i>safrinha</i> corn crop in the state, the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) made only minor adjustments to their corn estimate.  Imea expects that the average corn yield statewide will be 85.4 sacks per hectare (5,124 kg/ha or approximately 79 bu/ac).  The yield estimate may still be adjusted somewhat due to the fact that some areas of the state are still receiving rain, which is not typical for this time of the year.

	Imea did increase the <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage 35,000 hectares in comparison to their March estimate due to farmers continuing to plant corn in March even though the ideal planting window had closed in late February.  They now estimate the <i>safrinha</i> corn acreage in the state at 3.0 million hectares which is down 695,000 hectares compared to last year or a decline of 18.8%.

	Imea is now estimating that the state will produce 15.38 million tons of corn in 2013/14, which would be down 31.7% compared to last year or 7.16 million tons less than the 22.54 million produced in 2012/13.
