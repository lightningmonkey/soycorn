Dry Conditions to reduce Brazil's Sugar and Ethanol Production
<p>
	Dry conditions in south-central Brazil are impacting the 2021/22 sugarcane crop and the potential production of sugar and ethanol.  The summer rainy season ended at least a month earlier than normal this year in the major sugarcane producing areas leading to moisture stress for the sugarcane especially in south-central Brazil.
</p>
<p>
According to Conab's first assessment of the 2021/22 Brazil sugar/ethanol production, Brazil is expected to produce 38.9 million tons of sugar, which is down 5.7% compared to the 41.2 million tons produced in 2020/21.  Ethanol produced from sugarcane is expected to be 27 billion liters in 2021/22, which is down 9.1% compared to the 29.7 billion liters produced in 2020/21.
</p>
<p>
South-central Brazil is responsible for approximately 92% of Brazil's sugar production with north/northeastern Brazil responsible for 8%.  The major sugarcane producing states are Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Goias, Parana, and Alagoas.
</p>
<p>
 	The state of Sao Paulo is expected to produce 24.4 million tons of sugar (down 6.5% from last year), Minas Gerais will produce 4.5 million tons (down 4.3%), Goias will produce 2.4 million tons (up 5.2%), Parana will produce 2.5 million tons (down 3%), and Alagoas will produce 1.4 million tons (down 1.4%).
</p>
<p>
	The sugarcane production year in Brazil runs from April 1st through March 31st.  The sugarcane harvest in south-central Brazil usually starts in April and ends in November or early December.  Sugarcane is generally not harvested during the summer rainy season, which runs from November through March.
</p>
<p>
	Some of the sugar/ethanol mills in west-central Brazil have been retrofitted to utilize corn to make ethanol when sugarcane is not available.  Corn will be used to produce approximately 9% of Brazil ethanol production in 2021/22.
