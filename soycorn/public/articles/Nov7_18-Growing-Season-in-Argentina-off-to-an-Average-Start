Growing Season in Argentina off to an Average Start
<p>
<b>Argentina Soybeans</b> - The weather improved last week in Argentina with showers across most of the country including the previously dry areas in western Argentina.  Parts of Cordoba received over 2 inches last week, which were the first good rains since May 6th.  There is more rain in the forecast which should help to accelerate the soybean planting.

<p>
The 2018/19 soybean crop was 3.8% planted last week according to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange, which was up 1.8% for the week and slightly behind last year.  The most advanced planting is in the core production regions where as much as 20% of the soybeans have been planted according to the Rosario Commercial Exchange.

<p>
<b>Argentina Corn</b> - The rains received last week in Cordoba were very beneficial for the early planted corn that had been impacted by late season frosts and dry weather.  There is more rain in the forecast, which is good news for the early planted corn.
</p>
<p>
Corn planting only advanced 1% last week to 35.5% nationwide.  In the core production regions, the corn planting is 85-90% complete with 30-50% of the corn planted in southern Argentina and no corn planted in far northern Argentina.  The early planted corn will probably represent less than 45% of the total corn planted in Argentina.  Farmers in Argentina will start planting their late planted corn at the end of November into early December.  They will finish planting the late corn about mid-January

The condition of the early planted corn improved last week to 18% rated poor to very poor and 33.5% rated good to excellent compared to last week when the crop was rated 23.5% poor to very poor and 30% rated good to excellent.
</p>
<p>
The soil moisture in Argentina improved last week to 27.5% short to very short and 18.7% optimum to surplus compared to the previous week when the soil moisture was rated 50.6% short to very short and 8.2% optimum to surplus.  The soil moisture ratings are not nationwide ratings because they are only for areas where the early corn has been planted.  As more of the corn and soybeans get planted in Argentina, the soil moisture rating will take on more of a nationwide representation.
