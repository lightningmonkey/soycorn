Brazil Soybean Planting continues at Record Fast Pace
<p>
	<b>Brazil Soybeans</b> - The weather last week in Brazil was once again conducive to rapid soybean planting.  There were heavy rains across parts of central and eastern Brazil and the forecast is calling for more of the same.  The soybeans in Brazil are being planted at a record fast pace with 60% planted compared to 43% last year and 41% for the 5-year average.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mato Grosso</b> - In Matos Grosso farmers had planted 89% of their soybeans as of late last week according to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea).  This represents an advance of approximately16% for the week and it compares to 65% last year and 64% for the 5-year average.  The fastest planting is in western Mato Grosso where 95% of the soybeans have been planted followed by the mid-north where 94% has been planted.

The soybeans in Mato Grosso continue to be planted at a record fast pace which is good news for the soybeans and also good for the safrinha corn.  The mid-north region of Mato Grosso is the primary region for safrinha corn production in the state and the soybean planting in that area is now essentially complete.  In the municipality of Sorriso (located in mid-north Mato Grosso), which is the largest soybean and safrinha corn producing municipality in Brazil, the soybean harvest is expected to begin during the second half of December, which is 10 days earlier than last year.

<p>
As a result, it looks like farmers in Mato Grosso should be able to plant all their safrinha corn within the ideal planting window which ends about February 20th.  The one thing that could delay the safrinha corn planting would be a prolonged period of wet weather during January that could delay the soybean harvest.  Generally, earlier planted safrinha corn tends to have higher yields.

<b>Parana</b> - Soybean planting in Parana got off to a very fast start, but it has since been slowed somewhat by wet weather.  The soybeans in Parana are 69% planted compared to 74% last year and 66% for the 5-year average.  Deral rates the soybeans as 2% average and 98% good.
</p>
<p>
<b>Rio Grande do Sul</b> - Farmers in Rio Grande do Sul have planted 10% of their 2018/19 soybeans with good germination and stands being reported.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Brazil Corn</b> - The full-season corn crop in southern Brazil is 52% planted compared to 46% last year and 50% for the 5-year average according to AgRural.  AgRural is estimating that the full-season corn acreage in southern Brazil will increase 2.6% compared to last year.
</p>
<p>
In Parana, the full-season corn is 94% planted with the crop rated 4% average and 96% in good condition.  In Rio Grande do Sul, the full-season corn is 68% planted with 6% of the crop pollinating and the corn generally rated in very good condition.
