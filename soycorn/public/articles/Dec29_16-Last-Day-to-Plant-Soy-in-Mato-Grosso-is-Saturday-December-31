Last Day to Plant Soy in Mato Grosso is Saturday, December 31st
<p>
	Under new rules adopted for the 2016/17 growing season, the last day to plant soybeans in Mato Grosso is Saturday, December 31st.  The new rules also stipulate that all the soybeans in the state must be harvested by May 5, 2017.  The next soybean-free period in the state will then extend from May 5th to September 15th.  The new rules also expressly prohibit the planting of two soybean crops in the same field during the same growing season.

	  The soybeans in Mato Grosso were planted very early this year due to an early onset of the summer rains, so virtually all the soybeans have been planted well in advance of the deadline. These new regulations were put in place to help control the spread of soybean rust from one growing season to the next.  Other states in Brazil are expected to adopt similar regulations concerning soybean planting in the coming years.

	Brazilian scientists were very concerned that a second crop of soybeans planted during the same growing season would extend the viability of the soybean rust spores and allow the spores to survive until the next crop was planted.  They also argued that due to low yields and high costs to control diseases, that safrinha soybean production was unprofitable.  A few years ago when soybean prices were very high, farmers in Mato Grosso could make a profit growing a second crop of soybeans, but those profits disappeared when soybean prices slumped to their current levels.

	Farmers must also register their soybean acreage in the state's data base.  They have until February 15th to register via the internet.
