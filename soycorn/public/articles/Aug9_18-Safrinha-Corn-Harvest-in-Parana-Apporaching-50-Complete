Safrinha Corn Harvest in Parana approaching 50% Complete
<p>
	Farmers in the state of Parana have harvested 49% of their 2017/18 safrinha corn as of August 6th according to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral).  This represents an advance of 18% in one week, which is the most progress for a one-week period thus far this harvest season.  Even with the rapid harvest advance of last week, the harvest pa	ce is still behind that of last year when 67% of the corn had been harvested by this time.

	The harvest pace has been delayed this year due to delayed planting of the corn and recent wet weather when the crop was approaching harvest maturity.

At the end of July, Deral estimated the safrinha corn production in Parana at 9.2 million tons compared to their estimate of 13.2 million at the start of the season. Deral is estimating this year's corn yield at 4,410 kg/ha (68 bu/ac), which is down 20% from last year's yield of 5,510 kg/ha (84.8 bu/ac).

In their most recent report, Deral indicated that 30% of the remaining corn was in poor condition, 52% was in average condition, and 18% was in good condition.  Ninety five percent of the reaming corn was maturing and 5% was still filling grain.

Parana is the second largest safrinha producing state in Brazil after Mato Grosso.  The entire 2017/18 safrinha corn crop in Brazil has been a dissapointiment due to late planting, a prolonged period of dry weather during April, and an early end to the summer rainy season.  Conab is currently estimating the 2017/18 Brazilian corn crop at 83.0 million tons, but they will be releasing their latest monthly estimate on Thursday, August 9th.
