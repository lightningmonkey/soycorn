2019/20 Brazilian Soybeans 43.1% Harvested
<p>
The weather last week in Brazil was wet across central Brazil, especially the states of Goias and Minas Gerais, and generally on the dry side in far southern Brazil.  The near term forecast is calling for more of the same type of weather with the longer term forecast calling for the rains to migrate further north in Brazil.
</p>
<p>
The rains have slowed the soybean harvest in parts of central Brazil, but the farmers in Mato Grosso continued to make very good progress in harvesting their soybeans.  The forecast for far southern Brazil is mostly dry, especially in the state of Rio Grande do Sul where it is forecasted to be hot and dry this week.
</p>
<p>
	The Brazilian soybeans were 43.1% harvested at the end of last week compared to 56% last year and 44.2% average according to Arc Mercosul.  This represents an advance of 9% for the week.  The state of Mato Grosso leads the way with 84% harvested followed by 42% in the state of Parana.

<p>
	<b>Mato Grosso</b> - The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported last Friday that 84.1% of the soybeans in the state had been harvested compared to 87.7% last year and 68.5% for the 5-year average.  This represents an advance of 10.9% for the week.  The most advanced harvest is in the mid-north where 95% of the soybeans have been harvested.  The slowest harvest pace is in northeastern Mato Grosso where 64% of the soybeans have been harvested.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Parana</b> - According to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral), the soybeans in Parana were 42% harvested last week compared to 51% last year.  This represents an advance of 20% for the week.  The soybeans are rated 1% poor, 6% average, and 93% good.
</p>
<p>
<b>Rio Grande do Sul</b> - The soybeans in Rio Grande do Sul are 2% harvested with another 59% filling pods and 16% mature according to Emater.  The soybean harvest will pick up in March and extend until May. The irregular rains during the growing season is expected to result in irregular yields as well.  Emater is expected to release their latest estimate of the crop later this week.  The southern half of the state suffered the most this growing season due to the lack of rain.
</p>
<p>
<b>Tocantins</b> - Farmers in the state have harvested approximately 50% of the soybeans and the harvest has been slowed somewhat by wet weather.  According the president of the Soybean & Corn Producers of Tocantins, early yields were disappointing due to a 20-day period of dry weather, but yields of the later maturing soybeans have been satisfactory.  He is expecting a statewide average yield of 50 sacks per hectare (44.4 bu/ac), which would be 2-3 sacks per hectare (1.7 to 2.6 bu/ac) better than last year.
</p>
<p>
	Farmers in the state have already sold as much as 70% of their anticipated production for prices between R$ 70 to R$ 75 reals per sack (approximately $7.75 to $8.30 per bushel).  They are going to make a profit on their soybeans, but not as much as they had hoped due to higher production costs.
</p>
<p>
The state should also plant 200-230,000 hectares of safrinha corn and a good part of the corn was planted by the end of last week, which is considered the end of the ideal planting window.
