Wheat Planting in Argentina reaches 11.3%
<p>
	According to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange, farmers in Argentina have planted 11.3% of their intended 2017 wheat crop.  This is up 6% from last week and is nearly equal to the average pace.  Farmers in Argentina will continue planting wheat until the end of July.

The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange estimated in April that Argentine farmers would plant 5.5 million hectares of wheat (13.5 million acres), but they indicated in the latest weekly report that farmers may not be able to plant all of their intended wheat acreage due to excessive rains in parts of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, and Cordoba.
