Soy Harvest Complete in Mato Grosso, Brazil 71% Harvested
<p>
The weather in Brazil generally remains wet with the exception of east-central Brazil and the near term forecast is wet for central Brazil and dryer for southern Brazil.

Traveling through central Mato Grosso this week, we only saw one relatively small field of soybeans that was turning yellow and starting to mature.  A few isolated fields had been harvested too late to plant safrinha corn, but the vast majority of the soybeans (probably 95% of the fields we saw) had been followed by a safrinha corn crop.

The Brazilian soybean crop is 71% harvested compared to 74% last year and 69% for the five year average according to AgRural.  This represents an advance of 6% for the week.  The harvest is essentially complete in Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Sao Paulo.  The last major state to harvest is Rio Grande do Sul where 12% of the crop has been harvested.  They are also in the midst of harvesting the soybeans in northeastern Brazil where they are expecting new record high yields.
