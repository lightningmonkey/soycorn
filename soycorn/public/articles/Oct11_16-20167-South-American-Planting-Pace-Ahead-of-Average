2016/17 South American Planting Pace Ahead of Average
<p>
<b>Brazil weather</b> - The weather in Brazil last week was a mixed bag.  The accumulative rainfall for the week was uneven and not as widely distributed as it has been for the past several weeks.  The weather in far southern Brazil has been drying out for a number of weeks.  Some areas of Rio Grande do Sul have been 30 days without rain.  The forecast for this week is calling for additional chances of rainfall across southern Brazil.

<b>Brazil soybeans</b> - The 2016/17 Brazilian soybean crop is now 11% planted compared to 8% last year and 10% average.  AgRural is reporting that farmers in Mato Grosso have planted 19% of their soybeans compared to just 5% last year.  Soybean planting is most advanced in the state of Parana where the Department of Rural Economics (Deral) is reporting that farmers have planted 27% of their soybeans.  In Rio Grande do Sul the soybeans are 6% planted and in Mato Grosso do Sul the soybeans are 6% planted.
</p>
	<p>
In Mato Grosso the most advanced planting is in the western regions of the state where 36% of the soybeans have been planted.  The rains in Mato Grosso continue to be irregular with some farmers on pace to finish planting within 10 days and others still waiting to start planting.  The rains this week are expected to be irregular as well and farmers who have not yet planted are being advised to wait until the soil moisture improves.

The soybeans that have emerged are generally rated in good condition, but there are concerns being raised about dry conditions in Mato Grosso do Sul and Rio Grande do Sul.

<b>Brazil full-season corn</b> - The 2016/17 full-season corn crop is approximately 45% planted compared to 50% last year and 35% average.  Deral is estimating that the full-season corn in Parana is 68% planted with some areas in western Parana nearly complete.  Emater/RS is estimating that the corn planting in Rio Grande do Sul is 56% planted, but planting has slowed down in the state due to dry conditions.
</p>
	<p>
The soil moisture in southern Brazil going into the spring planting was quite low and the recent dryness in Rio Grande do Sul is resulting in moisture stress for the earlier planted corn.  Some farmers in Rio Grande do Sul are already worried that the corn yield potential might already be impacted.  The forecast for this week is calling for the chance of showers across southern Brazil.

<b>Argentine weather</b> - The weather in Argentina last week was mixed but improved.  Some of the dryer areas did receive needed moisture, but more is needed especially in the western and northern areas of Argentina.  The best soil moisture is found in the central and eastern areas.
</p>
	<p>
<b>Argentine soybeans</b> - There have probably been a few fields of soybeans planted in Argentina, but there has not been any soybean planted estimates released as yet.  The average planting pace for this week is approximately 1%.
</p>
	<p>
<b>Argentine corn</b> - The weather last week in Argentina was generally favorable for plating although it continues to be dryer than normal.  September was much dryer than normal, but recent rains have helped to recharge some of the soil moisture.  Dryer-than-normal conditions during spring planting helps to accelerate the planting progress.
</p>
	<p>
According to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange, the Argentine corn crop was 25.7% planted last week compared to 20% last year and 23% average.  In the core production region, the corn is approximately 60-70% planted.  In southern Argentina the corn is 20-40% planted and in northern Argentina it is 0-30% planted.
