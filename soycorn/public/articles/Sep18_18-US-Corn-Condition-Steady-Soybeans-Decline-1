	After four weeks of improving soil moisture, the moisture declined last week.  The soil moisture improved from mid-August until early September, which was very good for grain filling and pod filling.  Now that it is declining, that is good for dry down and early harvest.  Seems like a very good combination - wet when the crops need it and dryer when they are maturing.
