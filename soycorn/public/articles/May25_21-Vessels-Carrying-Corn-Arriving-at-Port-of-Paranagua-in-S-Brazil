Vessels Carrying Corn Arriving at Port of Paranagua in S. Brazil
<p>
The Port of Paranagua in southern Brazil announced yesterday that the vessel Aurora SB docked to start unloading 35,280 tons of corn from Argentina.  This is the first of four vessels carrying corn that is expected at the port over the next few months.  With the decline of the safrinha corn crop due to dry weather, it is expected that Brazil will import more than these four vessels of corn before the end of the year.

	The port director indicated that the Port of Paranagua is ready to import more corn and that they can accommodate corn imports as effectively as they handle wheat or even soybean imports, which happened last year.  Part of the corn can be unloaded directly onto trucks to be transported to the interior with the remainder of the corn put into storage at the port.

	Livestock producers in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul are particularly short on corn since those states do not produce a safrinha corn crop like the state of Parana.
