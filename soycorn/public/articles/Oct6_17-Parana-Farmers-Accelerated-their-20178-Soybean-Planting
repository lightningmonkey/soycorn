Parana Farmers Accelerated their 2017/18 Soybean Planting
<p>
	Everyone complains when the weather forecast turns out to be less than accurate, but this year in the state of Parana in southern Brazil, the forecast turned out to be correct.  Farmers in the state put their faith in the weather forecast and they were rewarded.
</p>
<p>
Earlier last week, the meteorologists were forecasting widespread good showers for the entire state starting over this past weekend.  Many farmers in the state started planting their soybeans in the dry soil in anticipation of the rains and they were correct.  The rains over the past few days were good with widespread coverage across the state.  The resulting good soil moisture should insure adequate germination and emergence.

The forecast is for continued chances of rain over the next ten days especially in southern Parana and extending southward into the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.  If the rainfall becomes excessive, it could delay the soybean planting and the remaining wheat harvest.
</p>
<p>
In the Department of Rural Economics (Deral) latest report, they indicated that 16% of the intended soybeans had been planted as of late last week.  The economists for Deral, Marselo Garrido, indicated to the Gazeta do Povo newspaper the the planted percentage will increase significantly this week.

Deral indicated that the full-season corn acreage was 33% planted last week.  The full-season corn acreage in the state continues to decline as farmers opt to plant more soybeans as their first crop and more corn as their second crop.  As a result, the soybean acreage in Parana in 2017/18 (5.48 million hectares) is expected to be 16 times larger than the full-season corn acreage (343,000 hectares).  Of the emerged corn acreage, 64% is rated in good condition, 30% is rated average, and 5% is rated poor.

The weather during nearly all of September was too dry to plant soybeans, which frustrated farmers who wanted to plant their soybeans as early as possible allowing enough time to plant a second crop of corn.  In parts of northern Parana, they had gone 50 days without a rain until this past weekend.
</p>
<p>
The winter wheat crop in the state is 71% harvested and that the remaining wheat is rated 22% in good condition, 41% average, and 37% in poor condition.  Dryness during June and July coupled with several episodes of frost have resulted in a disappointing wheat crop in the state.  All of the winter wheat acreage will be followed by a second crop of soybeans.
