2018/19 Safrinha Corn Planting Essentially Complete in Mato Grosso
<p>
The 2018/19 safrinha corn crop in Brazil has generally been planted about two weeks earlier than average.  Early planting of the safrinha corn is critical for good corn yields because the corn could receive one or two more rains before the end of the summer rainy season.  These last couple of rains would come during the critical grain filling period.

	<b>Word of caution</b> - The safrinha corn crop is getting off to a good start, but the weather during April and May will make-or-break the crop depending on when the summer rainy season ends.  Currently, farmers in Brazil are optimistic, but the future weather will determine the crop.

<b>Full-Season corn in Parana</b> - Farmers in the state have harvested 32% of their full-season corn.  The full-season corn still left in the field is rated 16% average and 84% good.  Deral is estimating that the 2018/19 full-season corn crop in Parana will produce 3 million tons, which would equate to only 20% of the state's total corn production.

<b>Safrinha corn in Parana</b> - The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) reported last week that 73% of the intended safrinha corn had been planted compared to 42% last year.  Recent rains have left farmers optimistic that a good safrinha corn crop could help compensate for a very disappointing soybean crop.  Deral is estimating that the safrinha corn crop in Parana will be 12.7 million tons, which would be an increase of 39% compared to last year and it would account for 80% of the state's total corn production.

<b>Safrinha corn in Mato Grosso</b> - Imea estimated late last week that 95% of the safrinha corn in the state had been planted compared to 84% for both last year and the 5-year average.  This represented an advance of 9% for the week.  The planting pace has slowed down a little in recent weeks due to wetter weather, but it is now essentially complete in many areas of the state.
