Soybeans in Southern Mato Grosso do Sul Impacted by Wet Weather
<p>
	The strong El Nino weather pattern that was in place for most of the 2015/16 South American growing season was not kind to soybean producers in southern Mato Grosso do Sul.  Very heavy rains impacted the crop during virtually the entire growing season, including during harvest.

	According to the Soybean and Corn Producers Association's Agribusiness Geographic Information System (Siga/MS), 85% of the soybeans in the southern part of the state have been harvested, which is slightly slower than the three-year average.

The Agriculture and Livestock Federation (Famasul) estimates that the soybean yields in the southern part of the state will be 48 sacks per hectare (41.7 bu/ac) or 4 sacks per hectare below the three year average of 52 sacks per hectare (45.2 bu/ac).  The lower production will cost producers R$ 400 million in lost revenues.

	Famasul estimates that Mato Grosso do Sul will still produce a record large soybean crop of 7.5 million tons due to an increase of 8.1% in soybean acreage in 2015/16.  Approximately two thirds of the state's soybeans are grown in the southern part of the state which was impacted by the wet weather.  In the southern region, the soybean crop is now expected to be 5.0 million tons, which is down from earlier estimates of 5.4 million tons.
