The safrinha corn planting in the municipality of Chapadao do Sul in northeastern Mato Grosso do Sul is over half planted which is 10 to 15 days earlier than normal.  The early planting is important because the corn could receive one to two more rains than normal before the end of the rains season and those rains would come at a time when the crop is filling grain.
