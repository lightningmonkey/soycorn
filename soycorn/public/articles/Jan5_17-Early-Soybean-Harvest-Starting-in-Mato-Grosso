Early Soybean Harvest Starting in Mato Grosso
<p>
	The early soybean harvest is underway in the state of Mato Grosso and farmers are hoping for a good year.  Farmers have started harvesting very early maturing soybeans (90-day maturity) that were planted during the second half of September.  The harvest pace will really pick up starting next week.  Early yields are generally good with some of the best yields in the range of 47-48 bu/ac while the yields in other areas are in the range of 35-44 bu/ac.

	There have been two more cases of soybean rust confirmed in the state bringing the total thus far to 5 confirmed cases.  Brazilian scientists are advising farmers all across Mato Grosso to apply a preventative fungicide application in order to slow the spread of the disease.  Farmers are also being advised to use fungicides that are currently being recommended by Embrapa.  Embrapa recently removed dozens of fungicides from their recommended list due to ineffectiveness against soybean rust.

	The scientists are particularly worried that some of the early maturing soybeans that are currently being harvested have not receive any fungicide treatments.  That could be a problem because if rust is present in the field during harvesting, rust spores can be dispersed during the harvesting process.  The spores are very light and they can be spread by the wind for more than 1,000 kilometers.  These spores could then in turn infect the later maturing soybeans where the yields could still be impacted.

	There have also been reports in the state of increasing problems from white flies and stink bugs which are the two main pests of soybeans this year in Mato Grosso.
