U.S. Corn Condition Declines Slightly, Soybeans Improve
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2017 U.S. corn crop declined 1% last week to 61% rated good to excellent.  Eight states indicated that the corn condition had improved last week and 9 states indicated that the corn condition had declined last week with 1 state unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the eastern and northern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the western and northwestern Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are:  Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Kentucky, Minnesota, and North Carolina.  The five lowest rated corn states are: South Dakota, North Dakota, Indiana, Kansas, and a tie between Colorado and Nebraska.

	Dryer conditions in the western Corn Belt led to lower condition ratings for the corn while sunny and dryer weather in the eastern led to improved corn conditions.

<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2017 U.S. soybean crop improved 2% last week to 59% rated good to excellent.  Ten states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week while 6 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week and two states were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the eastern and northern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found western and northwestern Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are: Louisiana, Mississippi. Wisconsin, Arkansas, and Tennessee. The five lowest rated soybean states are: South Dakota, North Dakota, Ohio, Indiana, and Kansas.

The dryer weather in the northwestern Corn Belt led to lower rating for the soybeans in that region.  The two key states of Illinois and Nebraska received much needed rainfall last week, which helped to improve the overall condition.  Ironically, sunny and dry weather last week in Indiana and Ohio helped to eliminate some of the excess moisture allowing the crop to improve.

<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture got dryer last week with 5 states indicating improved soil moisture while 13 states indicating lower soil moisture.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and western Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the northwestern and southern Corn Belt.  The five states with the highest soil moisture are: Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, Louisiana, and a tie between Tennessee, Minnesota, and North Carolina.  The five states with the lowest soil moisture are: South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Mississippi.

The nationwide soil moisture is still getting dryer, but the cooler temperatures are helping to hold down the crop's water demand and evaporation.
