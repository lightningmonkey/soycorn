	For the most part, the weather last week was beneficial for the late developing crop although there was probably too much rainfall in some of the western locations increasing the possibility of added disease pressure and maybe some quality issues.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2019 U.S. soybean crop held steady last week at 54% rated good to excellent.  Five states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week while 13 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the northern locations while most of the declines were found in the eastern and southern locations.  The top five rated soybean states are:  Wisconsin, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa.  The five lowest rated soybean states are:  Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois, and Michigan.

	The weather last week was also generally beneficial for the late developing soybeans in the Corn Belt, although it was also probably too wet as well in some of the western locations.  The late planted soybeans in the southern locations are being negatively impacted by hot and dry conditions.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture was unchanged last week with 9 states indicating improved soil moisture and 8 states indicating dryer soil moisture with 1 state unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the northern and western areas while most of the dryer conditions were found in the eastern and southern areas.  The five states with the best soil moisture are:  Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Kansas.  The five states with the driest soil are:  Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi and Indiana.

<p>
	The soil moisture situation has tuned into two extremes with too much rainfall in the northern areas and too little rainfall in the eastern and southern locations.  States such as Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin have 98-99% adequate to surplus soil moisture.  States such as Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky have 80-90% short to very short soil moisture.
