2018/19 Crop Situation in Argentina is Uncertain
<p>
I am a little conflicted about the weather in Argentina.  For the last several weeks, the weather in Argentina has generally been somewhat on the dry side.  The dryer weather was good up to a point because it helped to dry out the saturated areas left by the very heavy rains of about three weeks ago.  The forecast for this week is dry with increased chances of precipitation next week.  If the rains forecasted for next week do not materialize, some moisture stresses could start to develop in Argentina.

	Farmers in Argentina had a good week for planting last week.  The soybean crop was 40.7% planted late last week, which was up 11% for the week.  The planting pace is only 1% slower than last year. In the core production areas, the soybeans are 55% - 70% planted with 20% - 60% planted in southern Argentina and no soybeans have been planted in far northern Argentina.

	I would still consider the soybean crop this year as getting off to an average type of start.  If the rains in the forecast for next week actually do materialize, then there was little harm done by the recent dry weather.  If the rains do not materialize next week, then some moisture stress could start to develop.

As far as the corn is concerned, farmers in Argentina have finished planting their early corn and they have started to plant their later corn.  Nationwide, the corn is 38.2% planted, which is up 1.4% for the week.  In the core production areas, the corn is approximately 90% planted with 45% to 55% of the corn planted in southern Argentina and no corn yet planted in far northern Argentina.

The early planted corn is generally in good condition with adequate soil moisture.  The earliest corn is now transitioning into reproduction with approximately 7% of the crop pollinating.  For the time being, there is adequate subsoil moisture for the early planted corn.  I am getting a little concerned about the dryer forecast especially as farmers start to plant their later corn.  If the rains forecasted for next week do not develop, the planting of the later corn could start to be delayed.
