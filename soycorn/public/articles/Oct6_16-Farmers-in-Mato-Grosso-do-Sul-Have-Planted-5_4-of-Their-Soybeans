Farmers in Mato Grosso do Sul have Planted 5.4% of their Soybeans
<p>
	Farmers in most of Brazil were allowed to start planting their 2015/16 soybean crop on September 16th.  The Soybean and Corn Producers Association of Mato Grosso do Sul (Aprosoja/MS) estimated that as of September 30th, the farmers in Mato Grosso do Sul had planted 5.4% of their intended soybean acreage, which is 1% slower than last year at this time.

The soybean planting progress is most advanced in the far southern regions of the state where the soil moisture is suitable for germination and stand establishment.  In the central and northern regions of the state, the soil moisture is still inadequate for germination.  Fortunately, there are showers forecasted for these dryer regions later this week and next week.

In the southern part of the state, the soybean planting is estimated at 8.3% with some municipalities as high as 15%.  In northern regions the soybeans are 0.9% planted and 0.6% of the soybeans are planted in the central regions of the state.  In the dryer areas, the farmers are still waiting for enough soil moisture to start planting.  The soybean planting in the state is expected to be completed during the first half of November.

Aprosoja/MS is estimating that farmers in the state will plant 2.52 million hectares with an estimated yield of 51.5 sacks per hectare (44.8 bu/ac), which is the same as last year.
