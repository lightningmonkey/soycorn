Safrinha corn planting is now 92% complete compared to 96% last year and 90% for the 5-year average according to AgRural.  This represents an advance of 11 points for the week.  Mato Grosso leads the way with 98.8% planted.  The condition of the safrinha corn in Mato Grosso is rated good because of the timely rains thus far.  The earliest corn planted in Mato Grosso will start to pollinate probably within the next two weeks.  Farmers in Mato Grosso have sold 37% of the anticipated 2017/18 corn production which is very similar to last year and the 5-year average.

Meteorologists in Parana are already warning farmers that their late planted safrinha corn runs an increased risk of potential frost damage before the crop is mature.  They are warning that the frost risk will start by the end of May and increase in June and July.  They anticipate the greatest risk from frost will be in western Parana and southern Mato Grosso do Sul where it is not uncommon to experience a frost by the end of May.  Corn planted in early March in Parana would pollinate about mid-May and mature about mid-July.
