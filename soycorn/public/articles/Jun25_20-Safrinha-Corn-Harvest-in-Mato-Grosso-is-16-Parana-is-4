Conab estimates that the safrinha corn acreage in Mato Grosso increased 11.2% this year from 4.8 million hectares to 5.4 million hectares.  Conab estimates that the production will increase 9.3% to 33.9 million tons.

The weather across most of the state has been favorable for the development of the safrinha corn with the exception of the southern and southeastern parts of the state that experienced dryer than normal conditions early in the growing season that resulted in reduced germination and lower yield potentials.  Rainfall at the end of April and early May helped compensate for some of the earlier losses.

Conab is expecting variable corn yields in Mato Grosso with a statewide yield of 6,268 kg/ha (96.5 bu/ac), which is down 1.7% compared to last year.

In the state of Parana, farmers have harvested only 4% of their 2019/20 safrinha corn compared to 34% last year according to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral).  This represents only a 1% advance over last week.

Deral rated the safrinha corn in Parana as 17% poor, 39% average, and 44% good.  The rating is little changed from last week, but much lower than the 82% good rating last year at this time.
