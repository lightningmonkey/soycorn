This marks four weeks in row that the soil moisture has improved.  The soil moisture bottomed out at the end of July and it been slowly improving through August.  You can see from the Soil Moisture Index graph that historically the soil moisture bottoms out about the third week of August, so it happened a little earlier this year.
