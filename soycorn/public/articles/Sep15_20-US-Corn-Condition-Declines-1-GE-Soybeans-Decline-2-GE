U.S. Corn Condition Declines 1% G/E, Soybeans Decline 2% G/E
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2020 U.S. corn crop declined 1% to 60% rated good to excellent.  Eight states indicated that the corn condition improved last week, 9 states indicated that the corn condition declined last week, and 1 was unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the southern areas while most of the declines were found in the northern and western areas.  The top five rated corn states are: Kentucky, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, and Tennessee.  The five lowest rated corn states are: Colorado, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Ohio.

	The condition of the corn crop has declined for six weeks in a row and it is now rated just slightly better than 2019 and the long term average.  Once the corn condition has declined for this many weeks and the crop is this close to maturity, it will probably continue to decline for the next several weeks.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2020 U.S. soybean crop declined 2% to 63% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week, 10 states indicated that the soybean condition declined last week, and 1 was unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and southern areas, while most of the declines were found in the northern and southern areas.  The top five rated soybean states are: Kentucky, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, and Tennessee.  The five lowest rated soybean states are: Iowa, North Dakota Kansas, Ohio, and North Carolina.

<p>
	The soybean condition has declined for five weeks in a row and the crop is now 55-60% turning color, so there is very little chance it show any future improvement.  In fact, I suspect the condition will decline again next week.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture improved last week with 12 states reporting improved soil moisture and 6 states reporting lower soil moisture.  Most of the improvements were found across the Midwest, while most of the declines were found in the southern areas.  The five states with the highest soil moisture are: Tennessee, Arkansas, Minnesota, Kentucky, and a 3-way tie between Louisiana, Michigan, and North Carolina.  The five states with the lowest soil moisture are:  South Dakota, Indiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, and North Dakota.
</p>
<p>
	The big increase in soil moisture was no surprise given the amount of rain that fell across the Midwest last week.  In fact, 5 of the 6 states that reported lower soil moisture were in the southern locations that had received a lot of rain two weeks ago from Hurricane Laura and they are just now drying out before the next hurricane.
