Brazil Soybeans 71% Harvested vs. 70% Average
<p>
The soybean harvest in Brazil advanced to 71% late last week compared to 76% last year and 70% average according to AgRural.  This represents an advance of 12% for the week.  The forecast is for dryer than normal weather for the next two weeks across central Brazil, which should allow for an acceleration of the harvest pace.

The weather continues to be beneficial for the soybean crop in Brazil's southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul.  After a dry start to the growing season in the state, the weather improved in January and has generally remained good.  The state received up to 2 inches of precipitation over the past week across much of the soybean production areas.  As a result, Emater has increased their soybean estimate in the state and Rio Grande do Sul is now essentially tied with Parana for second place in soybean production in Brazil only behind Mato Grosso.

<b>Mato Grosso Soybeans</b> - The soybeans in Mato Grosso were 97.1% harvested late last week compared to 99.3% last year and 96.3% average according to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea).

<p>
	<b>Parana Soybeans</b> - The soybean harvest in Parana was 75% complete as of late last week.  The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) is estimating the soybean production in the state at 20.09 million tons, which is down from the February estimate of 20.34 million tons.  The average soybean yield in Parana is estimated at 3,599 kg/ha (53.6 bu/ac).
</p>
<p>
	<b>Rio Grande do Sul Soybeans</b> - The soybean harvest in Rio Grande do Sul is approximately 10% complete compared to 39% last year.  Emater increased their estimate of the 2020/21 soybean production in Rio Grande do Sul last week from their previous estimate of 18.95 million tons to 20.2 million tons.  The state is now essentially tied with Parana for second place in soybean production after Mato Grosso.
</p>
<p>
	Soybean production in Rio Grande do Sul in 2020/21 will be nearly double that of last year when the state produced 11.2 million tons.  Soybean yields in the state are expected to be up 76% compared to last year's drought plagued crop to 3,326 kg/ha (4.5 bu/ac). After a dry start to the growing season in November and December, the rainfall over the last three months improved as the soybeans were filling pods.  Rainfall across the state last week should allow for a strong finish for the crop.  The soybean harvest in the state should be completed by the end of April.
