Winter Wheat Planting off to a Slow Start in Parana
<p>
	Farmers in Parana are busy finishing harvesting their soybeans and planting their safrinha corn and starting to plant their winter wheat.  According to the Secretary of Agriculture for the state of Parana (Deral), farmers in the state have harvested 98% of their 5.073 million hectares of soybeans and they have planted 1% of their wheat.  The wheat planting this year is starting about two weeks later that last year when 7% of the wheat was planted at this time compared to an average of 9%.

Farmers were slow getting started in planting their wheat because of recent dry weather, but rainfall earlier this week and more in the forecast should encourage a faster planting pace.  Wheat can be planted in Parana until early May without any loss of yield potential.  The wheat that has already been planted is generally rated in good condition.

Deral is estimating that the wheat acreage in the state will increase 3% and the total production will increase 7% to 4 million tons compared to the 3.8 million tons produced last season.  The state of Parana is the leading wheat producing state in Brazil followed by Rio Grande do Sul.  These two states produce over 90% of Brazil's wheat crop.  The domestic demand for wheat in Brazil is approximately 12 million tons and the domestic production is about 6 million tons.  Most of the needed six million tons of imports will come from neighboring Argentina.
