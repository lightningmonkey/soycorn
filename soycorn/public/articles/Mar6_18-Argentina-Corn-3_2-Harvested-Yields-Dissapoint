Argentina Corn 3.2% Harvested, Yields Dissapoint
<p>
The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange left the 2017/18 Argentina corn estimate unchanged at 37.0 million tons and the corn in general is rated as 42.6% very poor, 33.8% poor, 18.1% fair, 5.5% good, and 0% excellent.  Once again, the earlier planted corn is faring better than the late planted corn.  The early corn is rated 68% poor to very poor, whereas the later planted corn is rated 85% poor to very poor (see next article).

	The earlier planted corn is 46% mature and the later planted corn is 70% pollinated or beyond.  The soil moisture for the corn is rated 54.2% very short, 34.2% short, 11.1% favorable, 0.5% optimum, and 0.1% wet.

The 2017/18 Argentine corn crop is 3.2% harvested and the early yields are averaging 6,420 kg/ha or 98.8 bu/ac, which is lower than last year and lower than earlier expectations.  The yields of the later corn is currently being determined and if the corn does not receive generous rains in the next week or two, the yield of the later planted corn will be worse than the yields of the earlier corn.  Unfortunately, there is not enough rain in the forecast for most of Argentina to reverse the overall trend.  There are some showers in the forecast for far northern Argentina, which could help the later planted corn in that region.
