During the first nine months of this year, the biggest corn importers of Mato Grosso corn have been Vietnam, Egypt, and Iran.  With three months left in 2019, the state has already exported 86% of the total corn exports registered in 2018.

Corn exports from Mato Grosso in 2019 would have been even higher had it not been for the increased demand for corn from the corn-based ethanol facilities in the state.  There are currently 6 corn-based ethanol facilities operating in the state and that is expected to incease to 11 by 2021.

Thus far in 2019, Brazil has exported 28.9 million tons of corn, or an increase of 130% compared to January to September of 2018
