Safrinha Corn Planting in Mato Grosso Reaches 65%
<p>
	According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), the safrinha corn planting in Mato Grosso is approximately 65% complete, which is slightly ahead of last year's pace.  The ideal planting window for the second crop of corn is now closed and any corn planted from this point forward runs a higher risk of running out of moisture before the grain filling process is complete.  The last date for safrinha corn planting in the state is about March 10th.

The potential problem for late planted corn is the fact that dry season may take hold before the corn is mature resulting in reduced yields.  In a normal year, the summer rains end about late April or early May and it remains dry until sometime in September when the summer rains start to return.  The dry season in Mato Grosso is hot and sunny with temperatures in the range of 80s to 90s resulting in a rapid depletion of the soil moisture

Even though the ideal planting window has closed, there is a big incentive to plant corn this year due to the very good domestic corn prices.  The average price for a sack of corn in Rondonopolis, Mato Grosso is now in the range of R$ 33.00 per sack, which is a very good price.

Approximately 30% of the soybeans in Mato Grosso will be followed by a second crop of corn.  The soybean harvest in Mato Grosso is 54% complete, which is about equal to last year.  The most advanced harvesting is in the western part of the state where 64% of the soybeans have been harvested.

Imea is estimating that the average soybean yield up to this point is 52.3 sacks per hectare (45.5 bu/ac), which is slightly below last year at this time when it was 52.7 sacks per hectare (45.8 bu/ac).  The soybean acreage in Mato Grosso increased 2.1% this year so the total production will be up as well.  Imea is estimating the state's soybean production at 28.5 million tons or 1.5% more than last year
