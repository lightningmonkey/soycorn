Embrapa Scientists to Conduct Corn Earworm Seminars in Brazil 
<p>
	Teams of Brazilian scientists will be conducting educational seminars all across Brazil this growing season instructing local extension personnel on the proper method of controlling emerging crop pests in Brazil especially corn earworm.  Twenty seven scientists divided into various teams will be traveling throughout all the major production areas of the country.  The effort is a joint collaboration between Embrapa, The Brazilian Cotton Producers Association (Abrapa), the Brazilian Soybean Producers Association (Aprosoja), the National Agricultural Confederation (CAN), and the Organization of Brazilian Cooperatives (OCB).

	The teams will canvas the nine major production regions of Brazil including:  MATOPIBA (Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui, Bahia), Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias, Cerrados Amazonicos, Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul.  The seminars will start in December and continue until March and each team of five scientists will bring along local information concerning the various pests that could impact the crops in the region and the best recommendations for integrated pest management including:  cultural practices, chemical control, biological control, and the related technologies.

	The main focus of the seminars will be the control of the corn earworm (<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>) that caused significant damage to the soybean, corn and cotton crops in Bahia last growing season.  Integrated pest management has the goal of sustainable pest management by keeping pest populations below the economic threshold.

	The teams hope to train 4,000 what are called multipliers.  These are generally local extension personnel or agronomist who will then go into the field and train producers on what they have learned at the seminars.
