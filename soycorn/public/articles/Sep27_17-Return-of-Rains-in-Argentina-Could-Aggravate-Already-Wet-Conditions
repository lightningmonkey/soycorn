Return of Rains in Argentina could aggravate already wet Conditions
<p>
	After extended periods of excessive rains that have left areas of Argentina saturated or under water, farmers in Argentina have benefited from a recent period of relatively dry weather.  Unfortunately, the dryer pattern may not last much longer.

The Ministry of Agriculture issued a bulletin this week that indicated that heavy rains may return this week to areas of Buenos Aires and Santa Fe provinces.  The first low pressure system should bring scattered showers mid-week to the provinces of La Pampa, Buenos Aires, Cordoba, southern Santa Fe, and Sao Luis.  These rains should then move into central and eventually northeastern Argentina later in the week.

On Saturday, a second low pressure system is scheduled to move into Argentina bringing heavy rains once again to La Pampa, western Buenos Aires, southern Cordoba, and Sao Luis.  The rainy weather is expected to linger into Sunday in northern Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre Rios.  These additional rains could aggravate the already saturated conditions in Buenos Aires and La Pampa

Farmers in Argentina have taken advantage of the recent dryer weather to plant 12% of their intended corn acreage and approximately 40% of their intended sunflower acreage according to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange.  They have also started the early wheat harvest in Argentina.  Farmers in Argentina will start to plant their intended 2017/18 soybeans in October.
