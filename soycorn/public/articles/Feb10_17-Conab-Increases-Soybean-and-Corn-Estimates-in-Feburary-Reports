Conab Increases Soybean and Corn Estimates in February Report
<p>
	In their February Crop Report issued on Thursday, Conab released their first survey results concerning the 2016/17 safrinha corn crop in Brazil.  They estimated that the safrinha corn acreage would increase 4.7% from 10.53 million hectares in 2015/16 to 11.03 million hectares in 2016/17.  The top four states for safrinha corn acreage in 2016/17 are:  Mato Grosso with 36.6% of the total, Parana with 20.7%, Mato Grosso do Sul with 15.0%, and Goias with 11.4%.  These four states will account for 83% of the total safrinha corn acreage in Brazil.

	Conab is estimating that the safrinha corn yield will be 5,310 kg/ha (81.7 bu/ac), which is 37.5% more than the 3,861 kg/ha (59.4 bu/ac) produced in 2015/16.  This is the same yield increase they have been using for several months.  The total safrinha corn production is estimated at 58.59 million tons or 44% more than the 40.67 million tons produced in 2015/16.  If verified, the safrinha corn crop would represent 67% of Brazil's total corn production.

	Conab increased their estimate for the full-season corn crop slightly from their January estimate.  The full-season corn crop in Brazil is now estimated at 28.81 million tons, which is 0.4 million tons more than their January estimate.
</p>
<p>
	The total Brazilian corn crop is now estimated at 87.4 million tons or an increase of 20.8 million tons compared to the 66.5 million tons produced in 2015/16 (+31.4%).  Conab is estimating the 2016/17 Brazilian corn exports at 24.0 million tons, which is unchanged from their January estimate.
</p>
<p>
	Conab is now estimating the 2016/17 Brazilian soybean crop at 105.5 million tons, which is 1.78 million tons more than their January estimate.  The 2016/17 Brazilian soybean estimate is 10.1 million tons (+10.6%) more compared to the crop of 2015/16 which was negatively impacted by hot and dry conditions.
</p>
<p>
The 2016/17 Brazilian soybean acreage increased 1.6% compared to last year to 33.77 million hectares (83.4 million acres).  The soybean yield is estimated at 3,125 kg/ha (45.3 bu/ac) which is up 8.9% compared to last year.  The 2016/17 soybean crop will easily set a new record for Brazilian soybean production.  Conab is estimating the 2016/17 Brazilian soybean exports at 59.0 million tons, which is up 2 million tons from their January estimate.
