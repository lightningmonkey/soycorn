Good Soybean Yields Continue to be Reported in Brazil
 <p>
The weather last week in central Brazil continued to be somewhat wet, but farmers did manage to advance the soybean harvest between showers.  I though the important news last week were the good rains recorded in northeastern Brazil.  The weather has been improving in northeastern Brazil for a number of weeks, which is coming at the critical pod filling period for the soybeans. In northeastern Brazil, the weather over the next 30-45 days will be important.

	Nationwide, the 2016/17 Brazilian soybean crop is now 18-20% harvested compared to 16% last year.

	The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported last Friday that 45.8% of the soybeans in the state had been harvested, which is up 15% from the previous week.  Last year at this time, farmers in the state had harvested 25.6% of the crop.  After a somewhat slow start, the harvest pace in Mato Grosso is now the fastest since Imea has been tracking the harvest.  Based on when the soybeans had been planted, Imea had anticipated that 55% of the soybeans would be harvested by now, so the harvesting is going just a little slower than anticipated.

	Over the weekend there were very heavy rains in western Mato Grosso.  In the region of Campo Novo do Parecis and Sapezal, some farms received 325 mm in 24 hours (13 inches).  Widespread flooding is reported in the area which is impacting the soybeans left to be harvested and the newly planted safrinha corn and cotton.  The forecast for this week is for heavy rains in the far northern regions of Mato Grosso and scattered showers in central and southern Mato Grosso.  The harvest pace this week will depend on where you are located in the state.  There will probably be limited harvesting in the northern part of the state and some harvest progress in the southern part of the state.

Soybean yields in Mato Grosso continue to be very good with only an occasional report of lower quality soybeans.  Conab is estimating that the statewide yield will be 3,277 kg/ha (47.5 bu/ac), which is 15.1% greater than last year's yield of 2,848 kg/ha (41.2 bu/ac).  If verified, Mato Grosso's soybean production of 30.34 million tons would represent 28.7% of Brazil's total soybean crop.

	Parana is the major state in Brazil that is furthest behind in their soybean harvest.  The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) reported late last week that 6% of the soybeans in the state had been harvested compared to 17% last year.  Cold temperatures earlier in the growing season had delayed the development of the soybean crop.  Yields are expected to be good with only minor reports of poor quality seed.  Over the weekend, there were scattered showers on southern Brazil with more rain in the forecast for this week.

	In Rio Grande do Sul less than 1% of the soybeans have been harvested and these are early maturing soybeans that were planted in the northwestern region of the state.  A few early yields are being report to be 50 sacks per hectare or 43.5 bu/ac.  The crop in Rio Grande do Sul is 10% mature, 44% filling pods, 30% flowering, and 15% in vegetative development.
