Southwestern Growing Region of Argentina still Needs Rainfall
<p>
	<b>Argentina Soybeans</b> - Weekend rains brought relief from the hot and dry weather that dominated Argentina for most of last week.  The heaviest amounts fell in eastern Cordoba, central Santa Fe, northern Buenos Aires and Entre Rios.  There was very little rain in the already dry southwestern areas of southwest Buenos Aires, La Pampa, and southern Cordoba.  The forecast for this week is cooler, but with limited rainfall.

<p>
	The rains over the weekend benefited the area of the country that was already doing fine, but they generally missed the areas that needed the rain the most.  In the Department of Rio Cuarto for example, which is located in eastern Cordoba, they did receive rain over the weekend, but earlier last week, temperatures reached as high as 40&#176C (104&#176F) and crops were suffering from moisture stress.
</p>
<p>
	In their weekly report, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange rated the soybean crop as 12.7% poor to very poor and 45.3% good to excellent, which is a lower rating than last week.  The soil moisture for the soybean crop was rated 28.3% as short to very short and 22.9% as optimum to surplus, which was definitely dryer than the prior week.  Only 2% of the soybeans were rated as having surplus soil moisture.
</p>
<p>
	In general, the soybean crop is 25% filling pods and 1% mature.  A few early maturing fields may start to be harvested this week or next week.  The highest rated soybeans are located in the core production areas where they received more rain over the weekend.  The lowest rated soybeans in the southwestern production areas which stayed mostly dry over the weekend.  More than 85% of crop is rated as average/good/excellent.

	<b>Argentina Corn</b> - The driest areas of Argentina are in the southwestern production areas including southern Buenos Aires, La Pampa, and southern Cordoba.  That area was hot and dry for most of last week and the later planted corn on the lighter soils or higher elevations in that area is starting to exhibit moisture stress.  The area received only limited rainfall over the weekend.  The temperatures this week in Argentina are going to be cooler and the weather will be mostly dry.

<p>
	The early corn harvest is under way in north-central Santa Fe and Entre Rios with good yields being reported.  
</p>
<p>
	In their weekly report, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange rated the corn crop at 9.6% poor to very poor and 56.9% good to excellent, which is a decline from last week.  The soil moisture for the corn was rated as 40.1% short to very short and 18% optimum to surplus, which is definitely dryer than last week.  Only 2% of the corn was still rated as having surplus soil moisture.  The weekend rains generally fell in areas that were already doing fine, but they missed the areas that needed the rain the most.
</p>
<p>
	The early planted corn is rated as 31% mature, whereas the later planted corn is rated as 58% filling grain.
