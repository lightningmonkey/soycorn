New Facility in Mato Grosso to Produce Ethanol from Soybeans
<p>
	One of Brazil's principal processors of grains, Caramuru Company, is in the process of expanding their industrial complex in the city of Sorriso, Mato Grosso to produce hydrous ethanol from soybeans.  The expansion is an R$ 115 million investment that should be up and running in two years.

	As reported by Gazeta do Povo, this imitative is a pioneering effort in the field of biofuels.  Brazil's current supply of ethanol is derived primarily from the processing of sugar cane with small amounts coming from corn or sugar beets.  This new facility is expected to produce 6.8 million liters of hydrous ethanol and 3,000 tons of soybean lectin annually.

Hydrous ethanol can be used in its pure form as a fuel for cars and it can be used as a raw industrial product in the manufacture of perfumes, cleaning products, solvents, and paints.  Soybean lectin can be used for the manufacture of chocolates, margarine, ice cream, biscuits, bread, pasta, and candy in addition to being used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics

	This is one more undertaking of Caramuru to extract the maximum value from soybeans.  The facility already produces: hipro soybean meal, soybean oil, and concentrated soybean protein (SPC), which is a product with a protein content over 60% and is used as a substitute for fish meal in animal rations.  This "environmentally correct" product is already being exported to Europe via Caramuru's grain terminals at the ports of Itaituba in the state of Para and Santana in the state of Amapa.  Both of these ports are part of what is called the "Northern Arc" of ports in northern Brazil.

	Caramuru processes soybeans, corn, sunflowers, and canola in five industrial complexes throughout Brazil where they employ 2,768 workers.  In 2016, the company processed 1,761,000 tons of soybeans and 233,000 tons of corn.
