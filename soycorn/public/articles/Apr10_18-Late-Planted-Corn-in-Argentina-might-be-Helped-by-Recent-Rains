Late Planted Corn in Argentina might be helped by Recent Rains
<p>
There have been some rains in Argentine, but I think they are coming too late for the early corn, but they might help some of the later planted corn.

The Argentine corn is 21.6% harvested as of late last week.  The early planted corn is 44% harvested and the later corn is 81% filling grain and 13% mature.  The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange is estimating the nationwide corn yield thus far at 7,300 kg/ha (112.4 bu/ac), which is down about 2 bu/ac from last week.  I expect the yields to continue declining as the harvest progresses.
