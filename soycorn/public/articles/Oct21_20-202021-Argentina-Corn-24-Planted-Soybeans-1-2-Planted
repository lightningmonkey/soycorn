2020/21 Argentina Corn 24% Planted, Soybeans 1-2% Planted
<p>
	<b>Argentina Soybeans</b> - There were some showers in northeastern Argentina last week, but many areas of central, western, and northern Argentina are still in the midst of an ongoing drought.  The best soil moisture is in the southern provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa. The forecast is calling for increased chances of rainfall this week, so that should help improve the soil moisture enough to encourage some farmers to start planting their soybeans.

	Soybean planting is slow to get started in Argentina with maybe 1-2% of the crop planted.  If the rains forecasted for later this week actually develop, it will allow farmers in the core production areas to get started on the soybean planting.  It is not late for soybean planting in Argentina, but farmers would certainly like to get started within the next week or two.

<b>Argentina Corn</b> - There were some rains in northeastern Argentina last week, but many areas in western and northern Argentina are still in the grip of a drought.  Most areas of Argentina remained dry last week.  The forecast is calling for increased chances of rain later this week across central Argentina.  There are reports of uneven corn emergence caused by dry conditions and cold temperatures.

	The 2020/21 Argentina corn was 23.3% planted as of late last week compared to 29.0% last year and 31.4% average according to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange.  This represented an advance of 2.5% for the week.  The corn was rated 10% poor to very poor, 59% fair, and 31% good to excellent.  The good to excellent rating is down 1% from the previous week.  The soil moisture for the corn is rated 24% short to very short and 76% favorable.  The favorable rating is down 4% from the previous week.

            The first phase of corn planting in Argentina is 46.5% complete compared to 47.0% last year and 61.6% average.  In the core production areas as well as the province of Entre Rios, the corn is 90% to 100% planted.  Corn planting continues slowly in Argentina and farmers would like to have their early corn planted by the end of October, but that appears to be doubtful this year.
