Brazil's Biodiesel Blend Increased to 12% Vegetable Oil (B12)
<p>
As of March 1, 2020, the biodiesel mixture in Brazil will be 12% vegetable oil blended with petroleum diesel (B12).  For most of 2019, the mixture was 10% (B10), but that was increased to 11% (B11) last September.  The biodiesel mixture will gradually increase to 15% (B15) by the year 2023.

	Most of the vegetable oil utilized in biodiesel production in Brazil is soybean oil, but the percentage of soybean oil is capped at 80%.  The Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (Abiove) has been pressing for a higher blend for several years stating that the industry is more than capable of meeting the increased demand for biodiesel.
