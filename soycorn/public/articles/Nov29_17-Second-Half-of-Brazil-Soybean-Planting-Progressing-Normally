Second Half of Brazil Soybean Planting Progressing Normally
<p>
After a somewhat problematic start to the 2017/18 growing season due to dry weather, the weather during November has turned beneficial for most of Brazil.  With an increasing chance of a La Nina, it remains to be seen if the beneficial weather pattern will continue going forward.  The Brazilian National Weather Service is forecasting a dryer than normal December-January-February in southern Brazil with normal to above normal rainfall in central Brazil.

	Over the weekend, there were widespread rains across southern Brazil, so the forecasted dry weather has yet to develop across much of southern Brazil.  Right now, I would have to say that the prospects for the 2017/18 Brazilian soybean crop are improving.  The earliest planted soybeans in Brazil are now starting to flower.

The soybean crop in Brazil is 84% planted according to AgRural.  This represents an advance of 11% for the week and the planting pace is now equal to last year's 83% and slightly ahead of the five-year average of 79%.  Planting is essentially complete in Mato Grosso (96%), Parana (96%), Mato Grosso do Sul (99%).  After a slower than normal first half of the planting, the second half of the planting is progressing at a slightly faster than average pace.
