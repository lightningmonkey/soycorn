Safrina Corn will be Planted Late in Mato Grosso do Sul
<p>
	The state of Mato Grosso do Sul in the center-west region of Brazil is recording some of the slowest soybean planting of any state in Brazil.  As of earlier this week, the soybean crop was approximately 73% planted compared to 100% planted last year at this time.

The Soybean and Corn Producers Association of Mato Grosso do Sul (Aprosoja/MS) indicated to the Minister of the Environment, Economic Development, Production, and Family Agriculture (Semagro) in a meeting on Monday, November 18th, that the delayed soybean planting in the state could negatively impact the safrinha corn crop in the state by delaying the corn planting past the end of the planting window on March 10th.

<p>
According to Aprosoja/MS, given the soybean varieties utilized and their planting date, it is estimated that 30% of the safrinha corn will be planted past the end of the window subjecting it to potential losses from frost, which are common during June and July especially in the southern part of the state.

Corn production continues to become more important in Brazil and for the farming sector in the state.  From January through October of 2019, Mato Grosso do Sul has exported a record 2.1 million tons of corn.

During the meeting, Aprosoja/MS members also expressed their concerns about the lack of needed infrastructure to move the corn to export facilities and the burdensome bureaucracy associated with transporting the corn across state lines or national borders.
