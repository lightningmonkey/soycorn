2021 U.S. Soybean Yield Unchanged at 50.0 bu/ac
<p>
The 2021 U.S. soybean yield was left unchanged this week at 50.0 bu/ac, and I have a neutral bias going forward.

	We are now in the most important time for soybeans as the crop fills pods.  Adequate moisture is critical for this process and additional moisture is most needed in the northwestern Corn Belt.  The western Corn Belt continues to struggle with the soybeans in North Dakota rated 17% GD/EX, South Dakota is rated 30% GD/EX, and Minnesota is 34% GD/EX.  The soybeans in Iowa held steady last week at 61% rated GD/EX.

<p>
The main reason why the soybean crop conditions improved last week due to a strong showing in the eastern Corn Belt and the Delta.

	The soybean condition improved 2% last week to 60% rated good to excellent.  The soybeans are 86% blooming compared to 84% last year and 82% average.  The soybeans are 58% setting pods compared to 57% last year and 52% average.
