Rains Return to Paraguay, Farmers are Now More Optimistic
<p>
	Soybean farmers in Paraguay experienced a troublesome start to the 2019/20 planting season.  Hotter and dryer than normal conditions during September and October delayed the soybean planting and resulted in a significant percentage of the crop having to be replanted.  Some farmers planted in dry soil in early September in anticipation of a rain that unfortunately either did not materialize or was much less than anticipated.  The result was poor plant populations that needed to be replanted.

	Most of Paraguay's soybeans are grown in the southern part of the country where the rainfall during September was 0.2 to 1.2 inches.  October rainfall was better at 1.6 to 5.6 inches, but the distribution was very uneven.  During both months, the temperatures in southern Paraguay were in the range of 2 to 5&#176C above normal (3.6 to 9.0&#176F).

	The rainfall in Paraguay has now increased, but farmers are still concerned about the irregular nature of the rains.  According to the president of the Soybean, Oilseed, and Cereal Producers of Paraguay in an interview with Noticias Agricolas, the soybean planting in Paraguay is now completed and farmers are still hopeful of acceptable yields.

	Total soybean production in Paraguay is a combination of the first crop of soybeans and a significant amount of safrinha soybeans planted after the first crop is harvested.  The first crop of soybeans were generally planted later than normal this year, so it remains to be seen how much of a safrinha soybean crop will be planted in Paraguay.
