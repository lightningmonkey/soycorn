Areas of Concern for the 2015 U.S. Crops
<ul>
<li>Ongoing problems of slow development and stunted crops in the eastern Corn Belt associated with the previous saturated conditions, including a loss of nitrogen. </li>
<li>Drying soil moisture in the eastern Corn Belt and a forecast for dryer than normal conditions going forward.  This could be a problem for the shallow rooted crops.</li>
<li>Potential for increased disease pressure.  For corn the potential problems could be from northern corn leaf blight, grey leaf spot, and anthracnose.  For soybeans the potential problems could be from sudden death syndrome and while mold. </li>
<li>Hot and dry conditions across the southern U.S. from the Delta over to North Carolina.  These adverse conditions in the Delta are probably coming too late to impact the corn crop, but it could impact the later developing soybeans.</li>
