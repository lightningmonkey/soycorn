Saturated Areas of Argentina Declining due to Dryer Weather
<p>
	The Office of Risk Management in the Ministry of Agriculture in Argentina (ORA) announced some good news for a change last Monday.  They indicated that after days of heavy rains last week that resulted in saturated conditions and localized flooding across the entire province of Buenos Aires, the recent dry weather has allowed for a decrease of saturated areas in the province

ORA reported that a big part of the province saw a reduction in the wetness categories from surplus to adequate due to the reduced rainfall.  The situation is expected to continue improving with no heavy rainfall in the forecast.  The forecast is calling for the most important rains of the week to fall on Thursday in northern Buenos Aires and Cordoba, and southern Santa Fe and Entre Rios.

Reductions of the saturated areas can't come soon enough for farmers in Argentina who are itching to start planting their 2017/18 crops.  Corn planting in Argentina starts in September and soybean planting starts in October.
