2019/20 Brazil Soybeans 67% Planted
 <p>
	The Brazilian soybean crop is 67% planted compared to 82% last year and 70% average according to AgRural.
</p>
<p>
	The weather in Brazil has improved, but it is still not what it should be for mid-November. The northern production areas of Brazil are doing the best, but there have only been recent improvements in the south-central areas of Parana and Mato Grosso do Sul.  There are still moisture deficits in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo, Goias, Bahia, and Maranhao.  The forecast is only calling for marginal improvements in the dryer areas.
</p>
<p>
The most advanced planting is in Mato Grosso with the slowest planting in far southern Brazil and in northeastern Brazil.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mato Grosso</b> - The soybeans in Mato Grosso are 97% planted compared to 99% last year and 91.8% average.  The only region of the state where the soybean planting is not essentially complete is northeastern Mato Grosso where the soybeans are 85% planted.  Soybean planting in the state has been ahead of average since about mid-October.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Parana</b> - The soybeans in Parana were 89% planted as of earlier last week.  The crop was 18% germinating, 79% in vegetative development, and 3% flowering.  The soybeans were rated 4% poor, 19% average, and 77% good.  The current conditions are an improvement over last year when dry weather from late November to early January negatively impacted the soybean crop because it hit during pod filling.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mato Grosso do Sul</b> - The soybean planting in Mato Grosso do Sul has been delayed by dry weather and the need to replant some of the earlier planted soybeans.  In the municipality of Aral Moreira for example, which is located in the far southern part of the state, soybean planting is practically complete except for the 10% of the crop that needs to be replanted due to dry weather and hail resulting in poor plant populations.
</p>
<p>
Even though planting is about three weeks later than normal in the municipality, farmers are still hopeful for good yields.  Soybean prices in the region are in the range of R$ 80.00 per sack (approximately $9.00 per bushel).
</p>
<p>
	The delayed soybean planting will delay the safrinha corn planting resulting in greater risk for dry weather or frost before the crop is mature.  As a result, some farmers may reduce their safrinha corn and opt for more small grains instead.

<p>
	<b>Northeastern Brazil</b> - Northeastern Brazil had been dry until this past weekend when they did receive some rain, but the forecast is indicating that the rains will not become regular until early December.
