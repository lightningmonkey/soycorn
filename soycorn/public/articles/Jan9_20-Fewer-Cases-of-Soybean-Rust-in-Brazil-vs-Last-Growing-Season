Fewer Cases of Soybean Rust in Brazil vs. Last Growing Season
<p>
At this point, there have only been 25 cases of soybean rust confirmed in the soybean fields of Brazil, which is far less than the 143 cases reported last year at this time.  Researchers have warned farmers though not to be complacent and to be ready to apply a recommended fungicide as soon as the disease is detected in their region.

During the 2018/19 growing season, the Brazilian soybeans were planted earlier than normal, and soybean rust also appeared earlier than normal as well.  The weather turned dryer than normal during last December and January, which helped to hold down the eventual impact from rust.

This year, the Brazilian soybeans were generally planted later than normal due to dry weather and the planting season lasted longer than normal.  That means there will be soybeans less advanced during January when the number of confirmed rust cases usually accelerates.  The latest planted soybeans will be exposed to the disease for a longer period of time compared to last year.

The state of Parana has recorded the most cases of rust with 15 followed by Mato Grosso do Sul with 4, Santa Catarina with 2, Mato Grosso with 1, Minas Gerais with 1, Rio Grande do Sul with 1, and Sao Paulo with 1.
