Brazilian Farmers Intend to Plant all Their 2020/21 Safrinha Corn
<p>
	Reports out of Brazil indicate that most Brazilian farmers are going to plant all their intended safrinha corn acreage even though 15% to 30% of the corn will be planted after the ideal planting window has closed.  Corn prices continue to be strong in Brazil and farmers are expected to make as much as 50% profit on their safrinha corn.  With potential profits that high, they will be willing to risk lower yields by planting the corn later than normal.

<p>
	The 2020/21 safrinha corn acreage could increase as much as 5-7% and if that happens along with an extended summer rainy season, there is a possibility that I will be increasing the corn estimate in the weeks ahead.

	<b>Rio Grande do Sul Full-Season Corn</b> - The corn in Rio Grande do Sul was 96% planted last week with 21% germinating and in vegetative development, 16% pollinating, 24% filling grain, 24% maturing, and 15% harvested.

<p>
	<b>Minas Gerais</b> - The corn acreage in the state of Minas Gerais is expected to increase 1% and the yields are expected to increase 1.4% with the total corn production up 2.4% compared to last year.
