2017 U.S. Crop Conditions Improve Slightly
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The rating of the 2017 U.S. corn crop held steady last week at 67% rated good to excellent.  Twelve states indicated that the corn conditions had improved last week and 6 states indicated that the corn condition had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found generally across the Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the southwestern Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are: Tennessee, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Colorado.  The five states with the lowest rated corn are: Indiana, South Dakota, Ohio, North Dakota, and Illinois.

	Even though the overall rating held steady, the shift of 2% from good to excellent resulted in an improved Corn Crop Condition Index.  The crop is still rated slightly below average and certainly less than last year.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The rating of the 2017 U.S. soybean crop improved 1% last week and is now rated 67% good to excellent.  Thirteen states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week and 4 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week with one state unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found across the Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the south and the west.  The top five rated soybean states are: Tennessee, Louisiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Kentucky.  The five states with the lowest rated soybeans are: South Dakota, Indiana, North Dakota, Ohio, and Missouri.

	The Soybean Crop Condition Index is essentially tied with the long term average, but still less than last year.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture improved last week with 14 states indicating that the soil moisture improved last week and 4 states indicated that the soil moisture had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found across the Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the southern locations.  The five states with the highest soil moisture are: Mississippi, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Indiana.  The five states with the lowest soil moisture are: South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Arkansas.

	The scattered rains last week and over the weekend helped to temporarily relieve some of the dryness especially in the northwestern Corn Belt.  North Dakota went from 63% short to very short on soil moisture last week to 43% short to very short this week.  South Dakota was not as fortunate going from 63% short to very short to 55% short to very short.

<p>
	Going forward I think we need to watch the soil moisture in South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas.
