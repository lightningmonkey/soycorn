2020/21 Argentina Corn 23% Good/Excellent, 16% Mature
<p>
	Even though the weather in Argentina has been somewhat problematic, it has been good enough to maintain the soil moisture at acceptable levels.  The forecast is calling for dryer weather once again, but for now, I am a little more optimistic concerning the 2020/21 Argentina corn production.

<p>
	The early planted corn in Argentina is 52% filling grain and 16% mature.  In the core production areas, the early planted corn is approximately 35% mature and there might be a few fields harvested this week.  The later planted corn is approximately 50% pollinated.

	The corn crop in Argentina was rated 9% poor to very poor, 68% average, and 23% good to excellent late last week.  The good to excellent percentage compares to 25% last week and 62% average.  The soil moisture for the corn was 13% short to very short and 87% favorable to optimum.  The favorable to optimum compares to 88% last week and 90% last year.

	The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange left their corn estimate unchanged last week at 46.0 million tons, but the Rosario Exchange increased their corn estimate 2.5 million tons to 48.5 million.  The USDA left their Argentina corn estimate unchanged at 47.5 million tons.</p>
