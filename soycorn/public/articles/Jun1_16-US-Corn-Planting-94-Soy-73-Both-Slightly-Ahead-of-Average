U.S. Corn Planting 94%, Soy 73%, Both Slightly Ahead of Average
<p>
	As of last Sunday, U.S. farmers had planted 94% of their intended corn acreage, which was equal to last year and slightly ahead of the 92% average.  The slowest planting continues to be in the eastern Corn Belt with Pennsylvania at 80% planted, Ohio at 84%, Indiana at 86%, and Michigan at 87%.  Major production states such as Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri had virtually completed the corn planting by last Sunday.  The corn emergence was 78% compared to 81% last year and 75% average.  The first corn condition indicated that 74% of the corn was rated good to excellent which was the same as the first rating in 2015.

The 2015 U.S. soybean crop was 73% planted compared to 68% last year and 66% average.  Soybean emergence was 45% compared to 44% last year and 40% average.  Once again some of the slowest soybean planting was in the eastern Corn Belt.  The first soybean condition rating will be released next Monday.

The recent summer-like warm and humid weather has been very beneficial for the early development of the crops.  This is a big improvement over the cool weather that dominated the first half of May.  The forecast looks rather benign for the first part of June and the growing season is getting off to a rather good start.

The topsoil moisture in the 18 major producing states is rated much less saturated compared to the June 1st rating in 2015 and slightly dryer than the fifteen year average.
