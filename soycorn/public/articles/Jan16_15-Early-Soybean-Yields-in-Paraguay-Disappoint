Early Soybean Yields in Paraguay Disappoint
<p>
	The early 2014/15 soybean harvest has started in Paraguay with an estimated 10% of the crop harvested.  The soybeans that are being harvested were planted in late August or early September.  Early yield results have been disappointing probably due to the dry weather that occurred during October.  The yields being reported thus far are in the range of 1,000 to 1,200 kg/ha lower than average (a reduction of 14 to 17 bu/ac).

	The later planted soybeans avoided the dry weather in October and are expected to have normal yields due to the good growing conditions that started in November.  Those soybeans will be harvested starting in February.  Many of the early harvested soybeans will be followed by a second crop of soybeans planted as soon as the first crop is harvested.

	Early estimates for the 2014/15 soybean crop in Paraguay had it as high as 9.5 million tons, but the disappointing yields from the early maturing soybeans probably means that the Paraguayan soybean crop will end up below 9 million tons.
