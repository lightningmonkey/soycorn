Argentina Corn 21% Planted, 5% Slower than Average
<p>
	The soil moisture continues to be short in the central and northern provinces, but there is adequate soil moisture in the more southern areas such as Buenos Aires and La Pampa.  The forecast for this week is calling for improved chances of rain in northern Argentina, but probably not enough to break the ongoing droughty conditions.
