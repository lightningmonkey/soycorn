Imea Rates 43% of Mato Grosso's Soybeans as Poor to Very Poor
<p>
	Since the start of the 2015/16 growing season, the soybean crop in Mato Grosso has faced very adverse weather conditions.  Instead of heavy rains that usually start in early November, many areas of Mato Grosso went for periods of 30-40 days without rain during November and December, while experiencing very high temperatures.  The adverse weather took a toll on the early maturing soybeans that were trying to fill pods under the hot and dry conditions.

<p>
	In order to accurately assess the condition of the soybean crop in the state, the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) conducted a survey of 384 farmers and personnel in the farm sector from December 16 to 18.  This was not a scientific survey because the participants volunteered to answer an on-line survey to rate the condition of crops in their area.  The state was divided into seven regions and each participant rated the crop in five categories based on the following yield potential:  
 </p>
 <ul>
<li>Excellent 	(more than 60 sacks per hectare or more than 52.2 bu/ac)</li>
<li>Good 		(55-60 sacks per hectare or 47.8 to 52.2 bu/ac)</li>
<li>Average 	(50-55 sacks per hectare or 43.5 to 47.8 bu/ac)</li>
<li>Poor		(40-50 sacks per hectare or 34.8 to 47.8 bu/ac)</li>
<li>Very Poor	(less than 40 sacks per hectare or less than 34.8 bu/ac)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The results of the survey were as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent 	12%</li>
<li>Good 		20%</li>
<li>Average 	25%</li>
<li>Poor 		23%</li>
<li>Very Poor 	20%</li>
</ul>
<p>
The two worst areas are the northeast region with 70% of the soybeans were rated poor to very poor and the middle-north region with 53% of the soybeans rated poor to very poor.  These two regions represent slightly more than half of the state's soybean production.  Since the survey was conducted, the state has experience two additional weeks of generally hot and dry conditions.
</p>
<p>
The survey concluded that the soybean yield in the state will be highly variable this year and the statewide soybean yield will be less than last year's yield.  Mato Grosso is the leading soybean producing state in Brazil responsible for approximately 30% of Brazil's total soybean production.
