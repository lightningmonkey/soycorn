Timid Soybean Planting Pace in Mato Grosso, New Regulations
<p>
	The state of Mato Grosso is generally where the first soybeans are planted in Brazil, but dry weather in the state this year has led to a cautious start to the 2015/16 planting season.  According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), only 0.5% of the soybeans had been planted in the state by September 28th, which is 1% slower than last year.

<p>
	In northern Mato Grosso only a few fields have been planted and most of them are under center pivot irrigation where farmers will plant a second crop of cotton after the soybeans are harvested.  The rainfall in this region of the state has not been heavy enough to insure adequate germination and stand establishment.  The forecast looks more promising and farmers in the region are hoping to start planting by October 10th.

<p>
	The situation in western Mato Grosso is similar to that of the northern regions with most of the early planting occurring where center pivot irrigation is available.
</p>
<p>
	Southern Mato Grosso has received the most rainfall thus far and farmers are planting in the municipalities of Campo Verde, Rondonopolis, and Serra da Petrovina.  Even in this region, farmers are cautious because they do not want to risk having to replant any of their soybeans due to a return of hot and dry conditions.
</p>
<p>
	The slowest area in the state for early planting is the eastern region where it is still hot and dry and very little rainfall has occurred.  As in the other areas of the state, farmers are hoping to start planting October 10th to October 15th, which would be about a week later than last year.
</p>
<p>
	Starting with this growing season, soybean producers in Mato Grosso will be allowed to plant their soybeans starting on September 15th and they must complete all their soybean planting by December 31st.  All the soybeans must then be harvested by May 5th, which is the start of the new soybean-free period.  Between May 5th and June 14th the only live soybean plants allowed are soybeans that may have fallen on the ground during harvesting and subsequently germinated spontaneously.  Even those volunteer soybean plants must be eliminated by the land owner.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the new regulations require that all soybean plantings must be registered with the Plant Protection Bureau for the state of Mato Grosso.  Producers have until February 15th to register their soybean production either electronically on the bureau's web site or by visiting a local office.  The new regulations also specifically prohibit the planting of a second crop of soybeans on the same area during the same growing season.

<p>
	Mato Grosso is the largest producer of soybeans and corn in Brazil responsible for 31% and 42% of the nationwide production respectively.
