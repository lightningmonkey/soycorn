Safrinha Corn Harvest in Brazil Slowed by Wet Weather
<p>
	Farmers in southern Brazil were actively harvesting what is expected to be a record breaking safrinha corn crop until wet weather moved into the area several weeks ago.  In some areas of western Parana, farmers have not been able to harvest corn for about two and a half weeks and they are starting to get concerned about the potential for lower grain quality and maybe even lower yields.  Farmers are also worried about spending more money to dry the corn when margins are already tight.

	The safrinha corn in Parana is 23% harvested and farmers in the state say they would need 3-4 days of sun and dry weather to resume the corn harvest, but unfortunately, the forecast is calling for more rain at least through the end of this week.

It has also been raining out of season in Mato Grosso as well, but the corn harvest has only been delayed for a few days and there are no quality concerns as of yet for the corn in the field.  The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported that as of late last week approximately 31% of the safrinha corn in the state had been harvested, which is just slightly slower than last year.

The average corn yield in the state is now estimated at 109 sacks per hectare (6,540 kg/ha or 100.7 bu/ac), which is down slightly from last week's 112 sacks per hectare (6,720 kg/ha or 103.4 bu/ac).  Dryer weather has now returned to Mato Grosso and the corn harvest in the state should be completed in approximately 30 days.   Grain elevator operators in the state are concerned because they have corn piled outside and any additional moisture could be a problem.  Nationwide, approximately one-third of the safrinha corn crop has been harvested.
