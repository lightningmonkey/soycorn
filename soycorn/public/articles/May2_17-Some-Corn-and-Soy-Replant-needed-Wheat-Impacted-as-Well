Some Corn and Soy Replant needed, Wheat Impacted as Well
<p>
	With the heavy rains over the weekend, the question now is if some of the U.S. corn and soybeans that had been planted will now need to be replanted.  Prior to the rains moving in, the corn planting in Illinois was 63% complete with 67% planted in Missouri and 97% planted in Arkansas.  If there is going to be some corn replanted, my guess is that most of the corn replanting would be in these three states.

	The corn in central and southern Illinois was 60-80% planted before the wet weather moved in over the weekend.  Many of those same areas received up to 4 inches or more of rainfall over the last several days resulting in ponding.  These ponded areas will need to be replanted at a later date when things dry out.  Newly planted corn can withstand saturated conditions for 48-72 hours before the seedling dies and my guess is that many of these ponds will not dry out within that timeframe.  There will also be some flooding in the bottom ground along local streams and rivers that will also need to be replanted.

	Another area of concern is southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas where the rainfall totaled 4-6 inches or more.  The corn in southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas is 85-95% planted and certainly some of those acres will need to be replanted.

	<b>Wheat</b> - I usually don't write very much about wheat, but I thought the situation over the weekend deserved a comment.  The three main wheat crops in the U.S. were also impacted by the weird weather over the weekend.  Heavy snows and freezing temperatures swept across the western plains where the hard red winter wheat crop in Kansas was approximately 44% heading.  The freezing temperatures and lodging caused by the heavy wet snow is going to cause yield losses, maybe up to 10%, but that is yet to be determined.

	The soft red winter wheat crop also received heavy rains and localized flooding, which could result in lost acreage and probably increased disease pressures for the crop.

	Even the spring wheat could not escape problems over the weekend.  The spring wheat in North Dakota is 18% planted (average is 33%) and the spring wheat in Minnesota is 21% planted (average is 49%).  The cold temperatures forecasted for this week in the northwestern Corn Belt will result in continued delayed planting.  I continue to feel that some of the spring wheat acreage will eventually be switched to additional soybean acreage.  The bottom line is that it was not a good weekend for the U.S. wheat crop.
