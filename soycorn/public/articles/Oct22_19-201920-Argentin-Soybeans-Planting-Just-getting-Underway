2019/20 Argentine Soybean Planting just getting Underway
<p>
Farmers in Argentina have just started to plant their 2019/20 soybeans.  There are probably a few fields of soybeans planted in the core production areas where farmers have completed their corn planting, but the amount of soybeans planted is less than a couple percent of their entire 2019/20 soybean crop.

The weather in central and eastern Argentina continues to be OK, but it remains too dry in southern and western Argentina.  The forecast looks slightly better for this week, but dryer again for next week.  I would categorize the start of the growing season in Argentina as generally uneven and sub-par.

There are dryness concerns in Argentina, but I feel it is still very early in the growing season to be worried about the potential soybean yields.
