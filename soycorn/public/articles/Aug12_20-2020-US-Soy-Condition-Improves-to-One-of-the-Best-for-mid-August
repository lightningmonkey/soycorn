2020 U.S. Soy Condition Improves to One of the Best for mid-August
<p>
	The U.S. soybean crop was also affected by the very strong winds that swept across the central Midwest on Monday, but soybeans are better able to withstand strong winds than corn.

	The month of August is "make or break" for the U.S. soybean crop.  The soybean condition has improved three weeks in a row and it is now rated 74% good to excellent which is one of the highest rating for soybeans at this point in August.  Therefore, the potential is there for a really good soybean crop if the crop could receive a couple more good rains during August.  A record high soybean yield is certainly within reach.

	As with the corn crop, the driest soybeans are in the western half of Iowa with pockets of dryness in northeastern Nebraska and southeastern South Dakota as well as northern Ohio and southeastern Michigan.  The dryer areas in the western Corn Belt received some rain over the last few days.

The weather last week was cool and dry for most of the week with hotter temperatures returning over the weekend accompanied by scattered showers.  The cooler temperatures helped to extend the soil moisture in areas that may have been short on moisture.  After a brief period of cooler temperatures and a brief warm up over the weekend, the forecast is now calling for a return of more seasonable temperatures.

	The 2020 U.S. soybeans are 92% blooming compared to 79% last year and 89% average.  The soybeans are 75% setting pods compared to 49% last year and 68% average.
