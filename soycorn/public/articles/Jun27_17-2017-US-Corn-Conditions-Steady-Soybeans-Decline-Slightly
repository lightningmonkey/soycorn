2017 U. S. Corn Condition Steady, Soybeans Decline Slightly
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The 2017 U.S. corn condition held steady last week at 68% rated good to excellent.  Nine states indicated that the corn condition had improved last week while 8 states indicated that the corn condition had declined last week with 1 state unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and eastern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the western and northwestern Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are: Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Kentucky and a tie between Iowa and North Carolina.  The five lowest rated corn states are: South Dakota, Indiana, North Dakota, Ohio, and Illinois.

<p>
	The concern for the corn crop has definitely shifted to the western and northwestern Corn Belt.  That region is currently the driest and the forecast for that region looks the driest as well.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The 2017 U.S. soybean condition declined 1% last week to 66% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week while 9 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week and 2 were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the central, southern, and eastern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the western and northwestern Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are: Tennessee, Minnesota, North Carolina, Kentucky, and a tie between Louisiana and Wisconsin.  The five states with the lowest rated soybeans are: South Dakota, North Dakota, Indiana, Ohio, and Nebraska.

<p>
	I think the major area of concern for the soybeans is also the western and northwestern Corn Belt.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture improved slightly last week with 12 states indicating that the soil moisture improved and 6 states indicating that the soil moisture declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the southern and eastern Corn Belt as well as the Delta while most of the declines were found in the western and northwestern Corn Belt.  The five states with the best soil moisture are: Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Michigan.  The five states with the driest soils are: South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois.
</p>
<p>
	Definitely the states to watch for soil moisture going forward are South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and select areas of Iowa, notably northwest Iowa, western Iowa, and southeastern Iowa.
