2020/21 Argentina Corn 93.4% Planted, 28% Good/Excellent
<p>
            While the weather has not been perfect, the recent rains have been good enough to improve the soil moisture and the condition rating of the corn.  Some of the earliest planted corn did suffer yield losses due to dry weather in December, but the moisture situation is now better for the later maturing corn.  The forecast is calling for more rainfall across the northern areas and light amounts across the southern areas and I would consider the recent weather as good enough to stabilize the crop in central and northern Argentina, but less than ideal in the more southern areas.

	The corn in Argentina was 93.4% planted late last week compared to 95% last year and 94.2% average.  This represents an advance of 2.5% for the week.  The last remaining area left to plant corn is far northern Argentina where the corn is 60-80% planted.

	The corn was rated 8% poor to very poor, 64% fair, and 28% good to excellent.  The good to excellent compares to 19% last week and 59% average.  The soil moisture for the corn was rated 7% short to very short and 93% favorable to optimum.  The favorable to optimum compares to 80% last week and 94% last year.  The early planted corn is 61% pollinated and 27% filling grain.  The later planted corn is 6% pollinated.
