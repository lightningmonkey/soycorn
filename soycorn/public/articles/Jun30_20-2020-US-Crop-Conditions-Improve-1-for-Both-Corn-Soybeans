2020 U.S. Crop Conditions Improve 1% for both Corn and Soybeans
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2020 U.S. corn crop improved 1% last week to 73% rated good to excellent.  Ten states indicated that the corn condition had improved last week and 8 states indicated that the corn condition had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the eastern and southern areas while most of the declines were found in the western and northern areas.  The five highest rated corn states are: Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.  The five lowest rated corn states are: Colorado, Kansas, Texas, Indiana, and Ohio.

	The slight improvement in the corn condition was no surprise given the rainfall last week.  The concern going forward are the hotter and dryer conditions in next week's forecast.  The corn is doing OK for now, so it can withstand some hot and dryer conditions so long as it is not prolonged.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2020 U.S. soybean crop improved 1% last week to 71% rated good to excellent.  Ten states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week and 8 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the eastern and southern areas while most of the declines were found in the western and northern areas.  The five highest rated soybean states are: Wisconsin, Kentucky, Iowa, Minnesota, and Tennessee. The five lowest rated soybean states are:  Mississippi, Kansas, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio.

	The slight improvement in the soybean condition was also no surprise.  The soybean crop could probably withstand a longer period of hotter and dryer conditions because the crop is still 3-4 weeks away from starting its critical pod-filling period.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's topsoil moisture improved last week with 9 states reporting improved conditions and 9 states reporting dryer conditions.  Most of the improved soil moisture was found in the eastern and southern areas while most of the dryer conditions were found in the western and northern areas.  The five states with the highest soil moisture are: Mississippi, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kentucky, and Louisiana.  The five states with the lowest soil moisture are: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Nebraska, and North Dakota.

<p>
	The soil moisture improved last week, but it is still slightly below the long term average soil moisture.  Three of the five driest states are in the eastern Corn Belt - Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan.  The other two driest states are in the far western Corn Belt - Nebraska and North Dakota.  In between are two states that are doing very well - Minnesota and Iowa.
