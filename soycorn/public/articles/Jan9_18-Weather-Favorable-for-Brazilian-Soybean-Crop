Weather Favorable for Brazilian Soybean Crop
<p>
The 2017/18 Brazilian soybean crop is turning out to be much better than what was originally anticipated back in September and October when dry weather delayed the planting.
</p>
<p>
The weather in Brazil has generally been favorable for the Brazilian soybean crop.  Central Brazil continues to receive amply rainfall and there is more rain in the forecast.  Farmers in Mato Grosso would actually like to see less rain going forward.  They feel that the heavy overcast, lack of sunshine, and high humidity could limit yields, foster diseases and impede the early harvest.  It is hard to pinpoint any significant areas of dryness in Brazil other than far southern Rio Grande do Sul and some areas in northeastern Brazil.  Most of the soybeans in Brazil are flowering, setting pods, and filling pods.

<p>
<b>Mato Grosso</b> - A few early planted soybeans in Mato Grosso are starting to be harvested.  It has been quite wet in Mato Grosso making the early harvest difficult.  The harvest activity in Mato Grosso should pick up starting about the 20th of January.  The yields in Mato Grosso are expected to be similar to last year.  A little dryer weather in Mato Grosso would be welcomed.

<p>
	<b>Parana</b> - In the state of Parana, the start of the soybean harvest will be 20-25 days later than last year and the harvest should start about February 20th.  A few fields may be harvested prior to that date if they were planted under irrigation.  The weather in Parana has been quite wet and farmers in Parana are worried about soybean rust.  Embrapa is reporting 91 confirmed cases of soybean rust in Brazil with 51 cases in the state of Parana (56% of the total).  The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) is rating the crop as 88% in good condition.

<p>
	<b>Rio Grande do Sul</b> - The soybeans in Rio Grande do Sul are planted later than in the majority of the country and Emater/RS estimates that 84% of the soybeans are still in vegetative development and early flowering with only 1% filling pods.  The weather has been erratic in the state, but the rainfall has improved over the last few weeks.  Farmers in far southern Rio Grande do Sul are still concerned about the overall dry conditions.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Goias</b> - The soybean planting in Goias was delayed the most by dry weather and as a result, the crop is further behind in its development than in neighboring Mato Grosso.  The weather has generally been favorable after the dry start.  Soybean harvesting in the state probably won't pick up steam until about February 15th.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mato Grosso do Sul</b> - The weather has generally been wet and favorable for the soybean crop.  Farmers in the state are also worried about soybean rust because the wet weather has prevented them from applying the needed fungicides.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Northeastern Brazil</b> - The weather has generally been favorable across northeastern Brazil and the majority of the soybeans are flowering and setting pods.  Soybean yields across the region are not expected to be as high as the sky-high yields recorded last year.
