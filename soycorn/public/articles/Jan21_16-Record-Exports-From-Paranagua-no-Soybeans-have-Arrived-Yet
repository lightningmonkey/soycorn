Record Exports from Paranagua, no Soybeans have arrived as Yet
<p>
	The recent investments in new equipment at the Port of Paranagua in southern Brazil continues to pay off with record amounts of exports from the port.  December of 2015 set a record for the month with 982,000 tons of grain exports or 31% more than the previous record of 749,000 tons set in December of 2012.

According to reports in SoNoticias, port officials are expecting new export records to be set in 2016 with the instillation of two new shiploaders in berth 213 by the end of February.  One of the shiploaders is already operational and the second is in the final stages of instillation.  The new shiploaders can extend 30 meters from the dock compared to the old ones that extended 20 meters.  This extra 10 meters will allow for the loading of larger vessels which can save up to 10% in maritime shipping costs.

The new shiploaders have a capacity of 2,000 tons per hour, which is a 30% improvement compared to the one being replaced.  The new equipment is easier to maintain and is more agile allowing for 15% time saving needed to move the shiploader around the vessel.  By the middle of 2016, two more new shiploaders will be installed in berths 212 and 214 of the Export Corridor.

	Corn was by far the dominate grain exported from Paranagua in December.  During last December, 12,337 trucks arrived at the port carrying 446,400 tons of corn.  In December the port exported 487,000 tons of corn compared to 219,000 tons in December of 2014.  The corn originates from the states of Parana, Mato Grosso, and Goias.  The main destinations for the corn are:  Iran, Vietnam, South Korea, Morocco, and Japan.  An additional 400,000 tons or more of corn is expected to be exported from Paranagua during the month of January.

	As of yet, no soybeans have arrived at the Port of Paranagua due to the somewhat delayed start of the soybean harvest. In January of 2015, the first vessel loaded with soybeans left the port by the end of January, but that will not happen this year.  In comparison, by the end of December 2013, the Port of Paranagua had already received 122 truckloads of soybeans.  The soybean harvest in Mato Grosso and Parana is expected to ramp up the last week of January and the first two weeks of February.
