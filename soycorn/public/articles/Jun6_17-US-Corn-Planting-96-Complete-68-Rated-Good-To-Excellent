U.S. Corn Planting 96% Complete, 68% Rated Good to Excellent
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The 2017 U.S. corn crop is 96% planted compared to 97% last year and 97% average.  The corn that is left to plant is concentrated in the eastern Corn Belt notably Indiana with 91% planted (average is 96%), Ohio is 91% (average is 96%), Michigan is 91% (average is 94%), Wisconsin is 91% (average is 92%), and Kansas is 90% (average is 96%).

Nationwide, there are 3,600,000 acres of corn left to plant.  If you combine Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, there are 1,616,700 acres of corn left to plant.

	  The weekly reports from Indiana and Ohio indicated that there are still saturated areas that need to dry out more before replanting can proceed.  The last day to plant corn in the eastern Corn Belt and still be covered by insurance is June 5th.  Therefore, I suspect that some of the unplanted corn acres will be claimed as prevent plant.

Another state with slow corn planting is Wisconsin where 91% of the corn has been planted (average is 92%).  The last day to plant corn in Wisconsin and still be covered by crop insurance was May 31st, so I suspect that some of those unplanted corn acres in Wisconsin may be claimed as prevent plant.

	The 2017 U.S. corn emergence is now 86% compared to 88% last year and 87% average.  The corn emergence is reported to be spotty in areas of the eastern Corn Belt due to standing water, saturated conditions, and crusting.  The corn plant population in many areas is going to be less than desired.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The 2017 U.S. soybean crop is 83% planted compared to 82% last year and 79% average.  The soybean emergence is 58% compared to 62% last year and 59% average.  The soybean planting is slow in the eastern Corn Belt due to previous wet conditions.  The final planting date for soybeans in most of Illinois as well as Indiana and Ohio is June 20th.  In northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin the final planting date is June 15th.
