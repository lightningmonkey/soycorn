Frosty Temperatures Sweep into Southern Brazil
<p>
	Weekend temperatures in southern Brazil dipped down to freezing or below in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.  According to Emater/RS (the Extension Service), the major concern for farmers in the state is for their wheat crop which is approximately 30% flowering and their full-season corn which is approximately 32% planted.  Up until now the wheat crop has been developing normally, but wheat is sensitive to frost at the time of flowering.  It generally takes a few days to assess the amount of damage caused by freezing temperatures.

 	Fruit growers in the state are also concerned because some of the peach and grape crops already have developing fruit and the low temperatures could cause damage to the crops.

It is not unusual to have episodes of frosts or freezes in Rio Grande do Sul during June and July.  It is unusual to have temperatures this during September, which is well into the spring growing season.
