Soy Acreage up, Soy Production Down in R. Grande do Sul in 2017/18
<p>
In their first estimate for the 2017/18 growing season for the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Emater/RS-Ascra is projecting an increase in soybean acreage, but a decrease in soybean production.
</p>
<p>
They are estimating that farmers in the state will increase their soybean acreage by 3.1% from 5.52 million hectares in 2016/17 to 5.70 million hectares in 2017/18.  In spite of the increased acreage, they are projecting a 9.8% decrease in soybean production from 18.57 million tons last year to 16.75 million tons in 2017/18.  The decreased production is the result of projected lower yields.   They are estimating the statewide soybean yield in 2017/18 at 2,938 kg/ha (42.6 bu/ac), which would be 12.6% lower than last year.
</p>
<p>
The statewide soybean yield in Rio Grande do Sul in 2016/17 set an all-time record high of 3,360 kg/ha (48.7 bu/ac).  This is an astounding yield for a state which is traditionally one of the lower yielding states in Brazil.  The high yields are being attributed to the ideal growing conditions in 2016/17.  Emater is expecting the soybean yields to be closer to trend line in 2017/18, thus the lower production forecast.
</p>
<p>
	As farmers in the state increase their soybean acreage, they are expected to decrease their commercial corn acreage.  The corn acreage in Rio Grande do Sul is projected to decline 11.6% compared to last year from 827,650 hectares in 2016/17 to 731,210 hectares in 2017/18.  The total corn production in the state is projected at 4.59 million tons, which would be down 23.8% from last year's production of 6.03 million tons.  The statewide corn yield is projected to decline 13.9% from last year to 6,287 kg/ha (96.8 bu/ac).
</p>
<p>
	Farmers in the state reported record high corn yields in 2016/17 of 7,500 kg/ha (115.5 bu/ac) due to the ideal weather and yields in 2017/18 are expected to be closer to trend line.
</p>
<p>
A similar scenario is expected to play out all across Brazil in 2017/18 as soybean yields return to more normal levels after record high yields in 2016/17.  Some locations recorded soybean yields in 2016/17 that were 15-20% above the previous record!
