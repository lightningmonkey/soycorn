2018/19 Safrinha Corn is 71.2% of Brazil's Total Corn Production
<p>
	In Conab's February Crop Report, they estimated Brazil's full-season corn production at 26.4 million tons and the safrinha corn production at 65.1 million tons.  Brazil's total 2018/19 corn production was estimated at 91.6 million tons.  With these current estimates, the full-season corn crop would represent 28.8 of Brazil's total corn production and the safrinha corn crop would represent 71.2% of Brazil's total corn production.

<b>Full-season corn in Rio Grande do Sul</b> - The full-season corn in Rio Grande do Sul was 28% harvested last week.  Recent high temperatures across the state have accelerated the corn maturity.  Early corn yields are better than expected.  In the northwestern region of the state, dryland yields are as high as 9,000 kg/ha (138 bu/ac) and irrigated yields are as high as 12,000 kg/ha (184 bu/ac).

<b>Full-season corn in Parana</b> - The Department of Rural Economics for the state of Parana (Deral) indicated that 8% of the full-season corn has been harvested.  They rated the full-season corn as 1% poor, 21% average, and 78% good.

<b>Safrinha corn in Mato Grosso</b> - The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported last Friday that 52% of the safrinha corn had been planted compared to 27% for both last year and the 5-year average.  This represents an advance of 22% for the week.  The fastest planting pace is in the mid-north where 60% of the corn has been planted.  The slowest is in the southern and southeastern areas where 40% of the corn has been planted.

In their second assessment of the corn crop in Mato Grosso, Imea estimated that the safrinha corn acreage in the state will increase 1.6% compared to last year to 4.69 million hectares.  They feel the acreage will increase due to the record fast soybean harvest which should allow for all the safrinha corn to be planted within the ideal planting window.  They feel the statewide yield will be 102.2 kg/ha (94.4 bu/ac), which would be up 2.6% compared to last year. The total corn production in the state is estimated at 28.7 million tons, which would be an increase of 4.3% compared to last year.

<b>Safrinha corn in Parana</b> - The Department of Rural Economics for the state of Parana (Deral), estimates that 38% of the safrinha corn in the state has been planted compared to 2% last year.  This represents an advance of 8% for the week.    The Soybean & Corn Producers Association of Parana (Aprosoja-PR) indicated that their safrinha corn is already encountering problems due to dry conditions, leaf eating worms and stink bugs.

 <b>Safrinha corn in Goias</b> - Farmers in Goias are planting their safrinha corn, but they are concerned about the irregular nature of the rains.  There are reports of some farmers planting their corn in dry soil in anticipation of forecasted rains.  Because of poor soybean yields, farmers in the state appear to be more cautious with the safrinha corn acreage, especially if they feel the weather will be less than cooperative.
