2020/21 Argentina Soybeans 98.6% Planted, 23% Good/Excellent
<p>
Recent rains especially across central and northern Argentina have brought a reprieve for the soybean crop which is now entering the critical reproductive phase.  The rainfall has not been as good in the more southern areas.  Temperatures last week in Argentina were in the mid to upper 90s.  The forecast is calling for more rainfall across the northern areas and light amounts across the southern areas.

I would consider the recent weather as good enough to stabilize the crop in central and northern Argentina, but less than ideal in the more southern areas.

	The soybeans in Argentina were 98.6%planted late last week compared to 100% last year and 99.6% average.  This represents an advance of 1.1%% for the week. The soybean planting should be completed sometime this week.  The early planted soybeans are 64.5% flowering and 8% filling pods whereas the late planted soybeans are 5.7% flowering.  There are reports of less than ideal plant populations for some of the double crop soybeans.

	The soybeans were rated 10% poor to very poor, 69% fair, and 23% good to excellent.  The good to excellent compares to 18% last week and 59% last year.  The soil moisture for the corn was rated 13% short to very short and 87% favorable to optimum.  The favorable to optimum compares to 68% last week and 96% last year.
