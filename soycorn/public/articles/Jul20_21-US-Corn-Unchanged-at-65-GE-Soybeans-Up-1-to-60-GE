<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2021 U.S. corn crop was unchanged last week at 65% rated good to excellent.  Eleven states indicated that the corn condition improved last week while 5 states indicated that the corn condition had declined, and 2 states were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and eastern areas while most of the declines were found in the northern areas.  The top five rated corn states are: Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Colorado, Nebraska, and Wisconsin.  The five lowest rated corn states are: North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, and Texas.

	The U.S. corn has made a slow improvement in recent weeks and the crop is now 56% silking under generally good conditions.  The weather during the second half of July will probably not be as good as during the first half of the month and the critical area to watch remains the northwestern Corn Belt.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2021 U.S. soybean crop improved 1% last week to 60% rated good to excellent.  Nine states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week while 7 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined, and 2 states were unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and southern areas while most of the declines were found in the northern areas.  The top five rated soybean states are: Nebraska, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Louisiana.  The five lowest rated soybean states are: North Dakota, south Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, and Illinois.

	The soybeans are slightly underperforming compared to the corn.  Part of the problem is localized saturated conditions in parts of the southern and eastern Corn Belt.  Going forward, the weather is forecasted to be hotter and dryer which is of particular concern in the northwestern Corn Belt where the soybeans are already in trouble.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The U.S. soil moisture improved last week with 12 states indicating improved soil moisture and 5 states indicating lower soil moisture with 1 state unchanged.  Most of the improvements last week were found across the central Corn Belt while most of the declines in soil moisture were found in northern Corn Belt.  The five states with the highest soil moisture are:  Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana, Missouri, and Illinois.  The five states with the lowest soil moisture are:  North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, and Arkansas.

	In the driest states, the soil moisture is still critical.  The topsoil moisture in North Dakota is 86% short to very short, South Dakota is 84% short, and Minnesota is 78% short.  The soil moisture in Iowa has improved to 33% short to very short.
