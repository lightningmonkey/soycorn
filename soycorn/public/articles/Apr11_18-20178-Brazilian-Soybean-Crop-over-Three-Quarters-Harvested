2017/18 Brazilian Soybean Crop over Three Quarters Harvested
<p>
The Brazilian soybean crop is 77% harvested compared to 82% last year and 77% for the 5-year average according to AgRural. The harvest is complete in central Brazil. In southern Brazil the soybeans are 84% harvested in Parana, 40% in Santa Catarina, and 35% in Rio Grande do Sul. The early yields in Rio Grande do Sul were better than expected, but the yields of the later maturing soybeans are less than expected. They blame the disappointing yields on soybean rust. Rio Grande do Sul ended up with the most cases of soybean rust in Brazil.

With some disappointing yields in Rio Grande do Sul and some yields not quite as high as expected in Parana, I think some of the highest estimates might decline a little in the weeks ahead to a range of 115 to 116 million tons.

In northeastern Brazil, the soybean harvest is 59% to 60% complete and farmers in the region are expecting record yields.  This will make two years in a row for record soybean yields in northeastern Brazil.
