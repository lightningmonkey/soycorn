Dry Weather could Delay Start of Soybean Planting in Brazil
<p>
	Dry weather across key growing areas of Brazil may prevent Brazilian farmers from getting started on their 2017/18 soybean planting as early as they would like.  The three key growing states of Mato Grosso, Parana, and Mato Grosso do Sul are all experiencing an extended dry season, which has prevented farmers from planting.

Farmers in the state of Parana in southern Brazil were allowed to start planting their 2017/18 soybean crop on September 10th, but dry weather in the state has kept the planters out of the field.  The state is also a major producer of dry beans and the start of the bean planting has also been delayed.  Farmers in Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul may start planting their soybeans at the end of the "soybean-free" period in September 15th, but they are too dry as well.

	The forecast is calling for very little rain over the next ten days with improved chances of rainfall during the last ten days of September.  Temperatures across central Brazil have also been very hot in recent days reaching into the upper 90's and low 100's.

	Traditionally, the summer rainy season in Brazil starts in October and many meteorologists in Brazil are forecasting that the rains will pick up toward the end of October.

	A delay in soybean planting in Brazil does not necessarily mean that soybean yields will be impacted.  Later planted soybeans can yield very well in Brazil if the weather during the remainder of the growing season cooperates.  A delayed soybean planting could definitely impact the safrinha corn crop in Brazil.  If the soybean planting is delayed, then the soybean harvest will be delayed resulting in a delay in getting the second crop of corn planted.

	If the planting of the safrinha corn is delayed, it could result in lower corn yields.  The ideal planting window for safrinha corn in Mato Grosso closes about the third week of February and virtually all of the corn planted in Mato Grosso is safrinha production.  Mato Grosso is the largest corn producing state in Brazil.  Nationwide, approximately 70% of Brazil's total corn crop will be safrinha production.
