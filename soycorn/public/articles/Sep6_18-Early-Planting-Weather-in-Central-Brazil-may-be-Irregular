Early Planting Weather in Central Brazil may be Irregular
<p>
	If the soil conditions permit, Farmers in central Brazil will start planting their 2018/19 soybeans on September 15th, which is the end of the soybean-free period in central Brazil.  The amount of soil moisture is always the critical factor in determine when farmers start to plant.

Currently, central Brazil is still in the midst of their annual dry season.  The last significant rainfall in the region was in May and the soil moisture is extremely short.  Farmers like to wait until they receive 2-3 inches of rain before they start planting to insure that they get adequate germination and stand establishment.

If they rush out and plant their soybeans immediately after the first rain of the summer, it may be several weeks until they receive the second rain.  When that happens, the soybeans emerge but then subsequently die due to the hot and dry conditions that are typical this time of the year.  That forces farmers to replant their soybeans at additional costs.

Most weather models have very little rainfall in the forecast for central Brazil for at least the next 10-15 days.  The Brazilian National Weather Service (Inmet) is forecasting an improved chance of rainfall during the third week of September. Thus far during the early planting season, the rainfall has been focused in southern Brazil.

	September and October can be the hottest time of the year in central Brazil.  The sun is directly overhead and very intense and there is a lack of could cover or rain to cool things off.  Daytime high temperatures can easily surpass 100&#176F this time of the year.
