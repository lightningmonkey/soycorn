	John Deere recently inaugurated its expanded South American Parts Distribution and Training Center in the city of Campinas, Sao Paulo.  The parts center, which originally opened in 2008, has nearly doubled in size with the expansion from 40,000 square meters to 74,500 square meters.  The parts center has access to highways, rail, the Port of Santos and the airports of Viracopos and Guarulhos.  Viracopos is the main cargo airport for the city of Sao Paulo and Guarulhos is the main international airport for Brazil.

The training center was added to facilitate the training of distributors, dealers, employees, and clients.  In the new training center there are classrooms, meeting rooms, offices and a capacity for 64 trainees.   This is the second major inauguration for new facilities for John Deere in Brazil this year.  In August, the company inaugurated a US$ 40 million expansion of one of its assembly plants.
