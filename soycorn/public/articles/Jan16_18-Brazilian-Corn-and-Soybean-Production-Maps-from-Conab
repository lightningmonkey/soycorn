Brazilian Corn and Soybean Production Maps from Conab
<p>
   I have been getting more questions recently concerning Brazilian corn production than soybean production.  I have also had been asked if there are any good maps showing corn production in Brazil.  Conab has corn production maps, but wading through one of Conab's monthly crop reports can be a daunting task due to the fact that they are usually more than 150 pages long and written in Portuguese!  Let me help you locate some of those maps.

<p>
	Conab's January Crop Report can be found at: <a href="http://www.conab.gov.br/">http://www.conab.gov.br</a>. That is Conab's web page and once on the page, click on the picture in the bottom left hand corner labeled: Graos - 4 Levantamento de Safra 2017/18 - January/2018 (Grain - 4th Crop Assessment 2017/18 - January 2018). Once the entire report comes up (and it takes a minute) go to the pages I have listed below.

<p>
	On page 75 of the report, there is a map of Brazil's full-season corn production and on page 77 there is a table listing the full-season corn acreage, yield, and production of full-season corn by state.
</p>
<p>
	On page 78 of the report, there is a map of safrinha corn production and on page 79 there is a table listing the safrinha corn acreage, yield, and production of safrinha corn by state.
</p>
<p>
	On page 80 of the report, there is a map of Brazil's total corn production by combining both the full-season and the safrinha production.  On page 81 there is a table listing acreage, yield, and production combining both full-season and safrinha production.

	On page 85 of the report is a map of soybean production and on page 87 is the table listing the soybean acreage, yield, and production by state.
