Month-By-Month Crop Production Cycle for Paraguay
<p>
	The month-by-month crop production cycle for Paraguay is very similar to the state of Parana in southern Brazil.  The main soybean production region of Paraguay is along the eastern edge of the country right across the Parana River from western Parana.  The weather, soils, and cropping practices in Paraguay are very similar to that of western Parana.

In fact, the vast majority of soybean farmers in Paraguay are Brazilians who moved across the border starting in the 1970's in search of cheap land.  This influx of Brazilian farmers has led to conflicts with many of the local population who do not recognize the legitimacy of the property titles held by the Brazilians.  The local courts in Paraguay have confirmed that the titles are legitimate, but the opposition groups believe the government that issued the titles was illegitimate at the time so therefore, the titles they issued are illegitimate as well.

The entire land reform issue in Paraguay is not going to be resolved any time soon, if ever.  The amount of Brazilians moving to Paraguay has dwindled to a trickle.  They now prefer to move to Bolivia or even to Mozambique in east Africa.  Mozambique speaks Portuguese and the climate and soils are very similar to that of central Brazil.  Land is extremely cheap in Mozambique and the country has sent trade missions to Brazil basically begging Brazilian farmers to move to the country and start farming.
