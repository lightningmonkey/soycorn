Brazilian Soybean Crop 25% Harvested
<p>
	The weather last week was wet again in central Brazil, but dryer in southern Brazil.  The forecast is calling for more wet weather across central Brazil with dryer than normal weather across far southern Brazil.

	According to AgRural, the soybean harvest in Brazil is 25% complete compared to 36% last year and 27% for the 5-year average.  This represents an advance of 8% for the week.  Mato Grosso continues to lead the way with the soybean harvest while Parana continues to hold it back.

	The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics is reporting that 58% of the soybeans in the state had been harvested by the end of last week.  This compares to 66% last year and it is about equal to the 5-year average.  The harvest is approximately 80% complete in the mid-north region and in western Mato Grosso. The slowest harvest pace is in the northeastern region where 26% of the soybeans have been harvested.

<p>
In the municipality of Sorriso, which is the largest soybean producing municipality in Brazil, the soybeans are 85% harvested and the average yield is 59 sacks per hectare (51.3 bu/ac) and the average price last week was R$ 60.00 per sack ($8.52 per bushel).

	For the most part, the wet weather has only had a negative impact on soybean yields in far northern Mato Grosso, especially in the municipality of Claudia.  In the far northern regions, there have been a few fields abandoned and some of the soybeans are unsalable because of the high moisture content.  That is the exception though.  The biggest problem thus far has been the need to dry the soybeans due to high moisture and problems on some of the rural dirt roads due to the heavy rains.

The soybean harvest in Parana continues to be very slow with only 11% of the crop harvested.  This represents an advance of only 5% for the week.  In the state of Goias the soybeans are 30% harvested with Mato Grosso do Sul 25%, Sao Paulo 22%, Minas Gerais 15%, with a few percent of the crop harvested in northeastern Brazil.
</p>
<p>
The harvest essentially has not started yet in Rio Grande do Sul where dry weather continues to impact the southern half of the state.  More than 80% of the soybeans in Rio Grande do Sul are grown in the northern half of the state and it is believed that potential loses in the southern part of the state will be compensated for with better yields in the northern part of the state.
