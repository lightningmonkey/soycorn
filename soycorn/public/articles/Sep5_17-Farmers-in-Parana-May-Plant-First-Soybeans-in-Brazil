Farmers in Parana may Plant First Soybeans in Brazil
<p>
	In my last report, I indicated that I was going to start the 2017/18 Brazilian soybean growing season estimating that Brazilian farmers would increase their soybean acreage 2.5% in 2017/18 from 33.9 million hectares in 2016/17 (83.7 million acres) to 34.7 million hectares in 2017/18 (85.7 million acres).  The Brazilian soybean production in 2017/18 is estimated at 109.0 million tons, which is down slightly from the approximately 114.0 million tons produced in 2016/17.

	Brazilian farmers are allowed to start planting their 2017/18 soybeans on September 10th in the state of Parana and September 15th in the state of Mato Grosso.  Generally, farmers in Mato Grosso plant the first soybeans in Brazil, but that may change this year and the first soybeans in Brazil might be planted in the state of Parana instead.

	The weather will determine where the first soybeans will be planted.  Currently, the weather in Mato Grosso it is hot and dry.  There were some rains in the state during the third week of August, but since then it has been hot and dry, which is typical for this time of the year.  The 10-day forecast for central Mato Grosso is calling for clear skies with no chance of rain and temperatures in the     upper 90's and low 100's.

In the state of Parana, they too received some rainfall during the third week of August and it has been dry since then.  The 10-day forecast for northern Parana is calling for temperatures in the upper 80's lower 90's with clear skies and maybe a hint of rainfall at the end of the 10-day period.
