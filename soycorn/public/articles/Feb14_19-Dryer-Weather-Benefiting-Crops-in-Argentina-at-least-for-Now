Dryer Weather benefiting Crops in Argentina, at least for Now
<p>
<b>Argentina Soybeans</b> - The weather in Argentina was dryer last week, which was generally good for the crops in Argentina because it allowed some of the saturated areas to dry out a bit.  The forecast is generally dryer as well especially in the more southern areas such as southwestern Buenos Aires and La Pampa.  Although the soils in Argentina have a good water holding capacity, if it stays dry for another week or two, moisture stresses will start to develop in southern Argentina.

 <p>
The Cordoba Grain Exchange released rainfall data from the month of January indicating that several locations within the province received as much as 12-14 inches of rainfall during January. They estimate that at least 40,000 hectares of soybeans were lost due to the saturated conditions.

Outside of the saturated areas, the soybean crop is generally doing very well.  The Rosario Exchange reported that in the core production regions of Argentina, the earliest soybeans are filling pods and the crop has good yield prospects.
</p>
 <p>
In their weekly report, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange rated the soybean crop as 9% poor to very poor 48.8% good to excellent, which is a slight improvement over last week.  The soil moisture for the soybeans was rated 5% short to very short and 61% optimum to surplus, which is about equal to last week.  Approximately 10% of the soybeans were rated as having surplus moisture compared to 17% last week.  The soybeans in general are 11% filling pods.

<b>Argentina Corn</b> - The weather was dryer in Argentina last week and the forecast looks dryer as well especially in the southern production areas.  Dryer weather going forward could impact the later planted corn in southern Argentina.
</p>
 <p>
Farmers in Argentina have planted 98.2% of their corn and they are still trying to finish planting the last 100,000 hectares of corn in the far northern part of the country.  This is very late for planting corn and the concern is that cold weather could set in before the corn is mature.  Outside of the saturated areas and the late planted corn in northern Argentina, the corn crop is doing very well with good yield prospects.
</p>
 <p>
The very early corn harvest has started in parts of Santa Fe and Entre Rios with yields in the range of 7,000 to 9,000 kg/ha (108 to 139 bu/ac).  The Rosario Exchange is anticipating very good corn yields in the core production areas of Argentina.  They estimate that the average corn yield in the core areas could be 11,100 kg/ha (171 bu/ac) with some as high as 12,000 kg/ha (185 bu/ac).  A more generalized corn harvest will start in about two weeks.
</p>
 <p>
In their weekly report, the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange rated the corn as 5.9% poor to very poor and 59.7% as good to excellent, which is little changed from last week.  The soil moisture for the corn is rated 7.1% short to very short and 48.6% optimum to surplus, which is a little dryer than last week.  Approximately 7% of the corn has surplus soil moisture compared to 11% last week.  The corn in general is approximately 50% pollinating with the early planted corn 13% mature and the late planted corn 30% pollinating.
