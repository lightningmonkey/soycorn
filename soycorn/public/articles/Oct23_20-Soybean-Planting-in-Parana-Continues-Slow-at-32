Soybean Planting in Parana Continues Slow at 32%
<p>
Farmers in Parana had planted 32% of their 2020/21 soybeans as of earlier this week according to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral).  This is double the 16% planted the prior week.  At this time in 2019, the soybeans were 45% planted and in 2018, they were 59% planted.

	Planting is slower than normal this year due to the delayed start of the summer rains.  Many farmers are still waiting for enough rainfall to insure germination and stand establishment, especially in the northern part of the state.  The near term forecast is calling for limited shower activity across the state.

	The delayed soybean planting means that the safrinha corn, which is planted after the soybeans are harvested, will be planted later than desired as well.  If the safrinha corn is planted after about mid-February, there is an increased risk of freezing temperatures occurring before the corn is mature.  The state of Parana is the second leading producer of safrinha corn after Mato Grosso.

	Deral also reported that farmers in the state had planted 86% of their full-season corn, which is up 8% from the prior week.  Farmers in the state have harvested 84% of their winter wheat, which is up 5% from the prior week.  Farmers will plant soybeans as soon as they harvest their winter wheat.  Parana is Brazil's largest producer of wheat and second largest producer of soybeans and corn.
