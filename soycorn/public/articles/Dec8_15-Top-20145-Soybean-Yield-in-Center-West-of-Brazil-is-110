Top 2014/15 Soybean Yield in Center-West of Brazil is 110.6 bu/ac
<p>
	The soybean yield contest held last year in Brazil resulted in a tie for the highest yields in the center-west region of Brazil, which includes the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goias.  Agronomist Pereira Neto and farmer Arthur Edwards both recorded a soybean yield of 127.17 sacks of soybeans per hectare (7,630 kg/ha or 110.6 bu/ac) on their three hectare plots.  The winning yields were both recorded in the municipality of Ponta Pora in western Mato Grosso do Sul, which is along the border with Paraguay.

	Both winners attribute their high yields to using the best production practices available for soybean production including foliar fertilization.  Small plots such as these are treated with "tender loving care" and are not replicated on a whole farm basis.  In fact, Mr. Edwards's total farm average yield for his commercial soybeans last year was 67 sacks per hectare (4,020 kg/ha or 58.3 bu/ac).  He has indicated that the will attempt to use all of these best practices this year on his 2,000 hectares of soybean production.

The maximum soybean yield contest is organized by agricultural professionals from 17 different organizations including:  Syngenta, BASF, Bayer, TMG, Monsanto, Sementes Adriana, Agrichem, UPL do Brasil, Stoller, Produquimica, Jacto, Instituto Phytus, Mosaic, and Aprosoja.
