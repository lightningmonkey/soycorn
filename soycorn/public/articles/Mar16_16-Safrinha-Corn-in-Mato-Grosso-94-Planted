Safrinha Corn in Mato Grosso 93.6% Planted
<p>
	According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), farmers in Mato Grosso have planted 93.6% of their intended safrinha corn acreage as of the end of the second week of March.  The safrinha corn planting advanced 10.5% for the week, but it is still 4.8% behind last year's pace.

The prospects of planting the remaining corn this week look poor due to the wet forecast from the Brazilian National Metrological Institute (Inmet).  Inmet is forecasting a week of cloudy weather with the possibility of afternoon showers and temperatures in the mid-90s.

The ideal planting window to plant safrinha in the state closed about February 20th, but farmers can still plant corn until maybe March 10th.  If farmers plant their remaining corn later this week, they will be running a very high risk of low yields due to the crop running out of moisture before the crop matures.

Mato Grosso is the largest producer of safrinha corn in Brazil responsible for approximately 35% of Brazil's safrinha corn acreage.  The safrinha corn crop will represent 66% of Brazil's total corn production in 2015/16.
