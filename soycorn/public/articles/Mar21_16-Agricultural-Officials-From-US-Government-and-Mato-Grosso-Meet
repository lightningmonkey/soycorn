	U.S. government officials and researchers wanted to better understand how fluctuations in the Brazilian currency is impacting soybean producers in the state in addition to the impact of last year's hot and dry weather on soybean production.  They also were there to build "bridges of understanding" between the U.S. and Brazil concerning agriculture and potential opportunities for increased bilateral commerce.
