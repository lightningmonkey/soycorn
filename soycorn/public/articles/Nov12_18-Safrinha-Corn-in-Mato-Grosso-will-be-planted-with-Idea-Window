Safrinha Corn in Mato Grosso will be planted within Ideal Window
<p>
Farmers in Mato Grosso planted their 2018/19 soybeans at a record fast pace.  The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported that 96% of the soybeans had been plated by late last week compared approximately 80% last year and the 5-year average.  In the main regions of the state where safrinha corn will be planted after the soybeans are harvested, the soybean planting is essentially complete.

	As a result of the early planting of the soybeans, the safrinha corn in Mato Grosso could also be planted at a record fast pace.  After looking at the planting dates of the soybeans and the maturity of the soybeans (early, medium, and late maturity), Imea concluded that 100% of the acreage utilized for safrinha corn production will be available for corn planting by the first week of February.

	The ideal planting window for safrinha corn in Mato Grosso closes about February 20th.  Corn planted after that date runs the risk of running out of moisture before the crop matures.  With the early planting of the soybeans, it looks like all the safrinha corn in the state will be able to be planted before the ideal window closes because safrinha corn planting in the state will start earlier than the first week of February.  Farmers in the state will start planting their corn immediately after the soybeans are harvested.  It is a common sight in Mato Grosso to see soybeans being harvested and corn being planted in the same field at the same time.

	Early planting is important for safrinha corn yields, because generally the earlier the corn is planted, the higher the potential corn yield.  Additionally, the earlier the corn can be planted, the greater the possibility that farmers in the state might plant some additional corn acreage.  Mato Grosso is the largest safrinha corn producing state in Brazil responsible for approximately 39% of Brazil's safrinha corn acreage.

	Early planting may also be important this year because of the possibility of an El Nino when the corn crop is developing.  The Brazilian National Meteorological Institute (Inmet) is forecasting the possibility of below normal rainfall in western Mato Grosso during the corn growing season due to El Nino.
