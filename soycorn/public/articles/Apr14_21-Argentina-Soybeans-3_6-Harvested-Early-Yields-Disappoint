Argentina Soybeans 3.6% Harvested, Early Yields Disappoint
<p>
	There were good rains across central and southern Argentina over the weekend with amounts of 2-5 inches in Cordoba, Santa Fe, entre Rios, and Buenos Aires.  The weekend rains slowed harvest progress, but the forecast is for dryer weather this week.  The 6-10 day forecast is for showers to return to western Argentina.

	The soybeans in Argentina were 3.6% harvested late last week compared to 16.2% last year and 15.9% average.  This represents an advance of 2.8% for the week.  Early soybean yields are highly variable and generally disappointing.  The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange reported that the average nationwide yield thus far is 3,110 kg/ha (46.3 bu/ac) with a range of 1,250 to 5,200 kg/ha (18.6 to 77.4 bu/ac).
