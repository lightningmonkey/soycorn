Areas of Concern for the 2015 U.S. Crops
<ul>
<li>Excessive moisture in the central, eastern, and southern Corn Belt delaying the completion of the full-season soybean planting and the double crop soybean planting.   </li>
<li>Ponding in the central and eastern Corn Belt resulting in drowned-out corn and soybeans.  Once it dries out, it will be too late to replant the corn, but the soybeans could still be replanted if it dries out in time, within about a week. </li>
<li>Wet weather delaying the wheat harvest, which in turn, would delay the planting of the double crop soybeans. </li>
<li>Nitrogen leaching due to the wet conditions. </li>
<li>Slow and stunted development of the crops in the saturated areas. </li>
<li>Increased disease and pest pressures for both crops due to persistently wet conditions. </li>
<li>Shallow rooted crops resulting from excessive moisture could make the crops more susceptible to dry conditions later in the summer. </li>
<li>High temperatures and dry weather in the southeastern U.S. (South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia) which could impact the corn first and then the soybeans in the region. </li>
