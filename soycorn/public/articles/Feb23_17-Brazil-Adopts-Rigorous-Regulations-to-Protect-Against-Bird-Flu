Brazil Adopts Rigorous Regulations to Protect Against Bird Flu
<p>
	In an effort to prevent the entry of bird flu into Brazil, the Brazilian government is adopting more rigorous sanitization requirements for poultry producers in the country.
</p>
<p>
Among the new requirements is the installation of screens on any poultry production facility to prevent wild birds from mingling with domestic poultry.  Producers must also install disinfection equipment to disinfect equipment that moves from farm to farm.  The animals must also be supplied with only chlorine treated water.

The Brazilian Minister of Agriculture, Blairo Maggi, stated that if bird flu is found in Brazil, the losses to the poultry industry would be uncalculatable.  He feels that Brazil's poultry exports could be in jeopardy if there is an outbreak of bird flu in Brazil.

Some poultry producers in Brazil already have these measures in place, but it is not universal.  In the state of Sao Paulo for example, it is estimated that only 40% of the poultry production facilities are in accordance with the new regulations.  On the other hand, in the state of Goias, it is estimated that nearly 100% of the facilities meet the new regulations.

Poultry producers will be responsible for paying for the upgrades and they will have one year to comply with the new regulations.  The Minister stated that the new 2017/18 Harvest Plan would have financing available for producers to adhere to the new regulations.
