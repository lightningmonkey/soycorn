U.S. Crop Conditions Basically Hold Steady
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. corn crop held steady last week at 69% rated good to excellent.  Eleven states indicated that the corn condition improved last week and 4 states indicated that the corn condition had declined last week with three states unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found generally across the Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the eastern areas (Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and North Dakota).  The top five rated corn states are: Minnesota, Tennessee, Iowa, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania.  The five states with the lowest rated corn are: North Carolina, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois.

	The corn condition has basically remained unchanged for the last two months and the changes this week were very minor for most states.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2015 U.S. soybean crop held steady last week at 63% rated good to excellent.  Eleven states indicated that the soybean condition had improved last week and 6 states indicated that the soybean condition had declined last week with one state unchanged.  Most of the improvements were found in the central and western areas while most of the declines were found in the eastern and southern areas.  The top five rated soybean states are:  Minnesota, Tennessee, Iowa, Wisconsin, and South Dakota.

	<b>Soil moisture</b> - After heavy rains moved across the Midwest last week, the nation's soil moisture improved for the first time in seven weeks.  Fifteen states indicated that the soils got wetter last week and 3 states indicated that the soils got dryer last week (Illinois, Kentucky, and Ohio).  The five states with the wettest soils are: Missouri, Tennessee, Iowa, Kentucky, and Minnesota.  The five states with the driest soils are: Louisiana, North Carolina, Mississippi, Nebraska, and Arkansas.

	With the heavy rains that fell across much of the western Corn Belt last week, it is no surprise that the nation's soil moisture improved last week.  The pattern for soil moisture this year is remarkably similar to last year's pattern.
