Marfrig Global Foods Launches Carbon-Neutral Viva Beef
<p>
The Brazilian beef processor Marfrig Global Foods recently announced their Marfrig Green Plan which is an ambitious plan to have their suppliers produce 100% sustainable beef production with zero deforestation within 10 years.

<p>
	As part of their goal of sustainable beef production, Marfrig has launched a new carbon-neutral beef product called Viva.  Viva beef will come from farms that have been certified as sustainable production and carbon-neutral.
</p>
<p>
	The carbon neutral beef was developed in conjunction with the Brazilian Agriculture Research Service (Embrapa).  The cattle will be produced on farms where the methane gas emissions from the cattle will be offset by cultivating forest plantations or other agricultural practices.  Methane gas is a natural byproduct of cattle and other ruminant digestion and it is a potent greenhouse gas.

	Initially, the Viva beef will come from 300 to 400 cattle per month produced on the Santa Verginia Agro farm in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.  The production will expand as more certified sustainable farms come online.  The company is investing R$ 10 million in research, development, and certification for the Viva beef.  Viva beef will initially be sold in Brazil, but the company plans to sell the products internationally as well.

	Marfrig is one of the leaders in beef production in the world with receipts of R$ 41.4 billion in 2018.  The company has the capacity to process 32,000 cattle per day in their South American and North American facilities and the company produces 232,000 tons of hamburgers per year.  Marfrig has 30,000 employees spread across 35 processing facilities and their beef products are sold both domestically and internationally.
