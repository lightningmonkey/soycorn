Most of the improvements were found in the southern and northwestern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the central and eastern Corn Belt.

With the warmer temperatures and limited rainfall, the soil moisture across the country declined for the second straight week and it is now dryer than the long term average.  Any improvement in soil moisture from this point forward would have limited benefit.

The state of Illinois is now the driest state rated 75% short to very short followed by Michigan at 61% short, Kansas at 58% short, Iowa at 51% short, and South Dakota at 48% short.
