U.S. Corn Condition Improves Slightly, Soybean Condition Steady
<p>
	<b>Corn</b> - The condition of the 2016 U.S. corn crop improved 1% last week to 75% rated good to excellent.  Seven states indicated that the corn condition improved last week, 6 states indicated that the corn condition declined last week, and 5 states indicated no change.  Most of the improvements were found in the eastern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the western Corn Belt.  The top five rated corn states are: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, and a tie between North Dakota and Colorado.  The five lowest rated corn states are: Ohio, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Texas.

	Once again there was very little change in the corn condition last week.  With the abundant soil moisture in the Corn Belt, I suspect that the condition of the corn crop will remain about the same for the remainder of the growing season.

	<b>Soybeans</b> - The condition of the 2016 U.S. soybean crop held steady last week at 72% rated good to excellent.  Eight states indicated that the soybean condition improved last week and 10 states indicated that the condition declined last week.  Most of the improvements were found in the eastern Corn Belt and the northwestern Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the central Corn Belt.  The top five rated soybean states are: Wisconsin, Tennessee, Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois.  The five lowest rated soybean states are: Ohio, South Dakota, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Michigan.
</p>
<p>
	With all the abundant soil moisture, I am a little surprised the condition of the soybeans did not increase last week.  These are very good conditions for the soybean crop.

	<b>Soil Moisture</b> - The nation's soil moisture improved last week with 12 states indicating improved moisture and 5 states indicating declining soil moisture.  Most of the improvements were found across the Corn Belt while most of the declines were found in the western Corn Belt.  The five states with the highest soil moisture are: Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, and Illinois.  The five states with the lowest soil moisture are: South Dakar, Nebraska, Ohio, North Carolina, and Kansas.

<p>
	The soil moisture is now better than last year and much better than the long term average.  Normally, this is the week of the summer when the soil moisture reaches its lowest point, but not this year.  This year the soil moisture has been improving at a time when it is normally getting dryer.
