2020/21 Argentina Corn 7% Harvested vs. 14% Average
<p>
	March rains were more beneficial for the later planted corn that is still filling grain.  The earlier planted corn was much further along in its development and probably only saw limited benefits from the recent rains.

The recent rainfall in Argentina appears to be enough to stabilize the crops at a somewhat lower level, at least for the time being.  The provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa received some good rains over the weekend with some areas receiving as much as 5 inches.  The weekend rains were generally limited to far northern and far southern Argentina with the central region staying mostly dry.

The rainfall in Argentina has been very irregular this growing season, so we should expect irregular yields as well. The forecast is calling for only limited rainfall, so the crops are not safe from renewed deterioration if the rainfall disappoints going forward.

	The corn in Argentina was 7% harvested late last week compared to 15.8% last year and 14% average.  This represents an advance of 1.1% for the week.   The early planted corn was 61% filling grain and 14% harvested, whereas the later planted corn was 50% filling grain and 2% approaching maturity.  The early corn yields continue to be below expectations especially in the eastern production areas and are in the range of 5,720 to 8,600 kg/ha (90.9 to 136.7 bu/ac).

	The corn was rated 20% poor/very poor, 54% fair, and 26% good/excellent late last week.  The good/excellent percentage compares to 22% the prior week and 32% average.  The soil moisture for the corn was rated 29% short/very short and 71% favorable/optimum.  The favorable/optimum compares to 67% the prior week and 73% last year.

	The later planted corn will continue to need additional precipitation to maintain current yield prospects.
