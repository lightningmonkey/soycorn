Safrinha Corn Harvest in Brazil reaches 50%
<p>
Dryer weather in Brazil last week allowed farmers to make good progress on their safrinha corn harvest.  According to AgRural, the 2017/18 safrinha corn harvest is now 49% complete compared to 63% last year and 55% for the 5-year average.  The safrinha corn harvest advanced 13% last week.

Farmers in Mato Grosso have harvested 80% of their safrinha corn compared to 88% last year and 81% for the 5-year average.  The corn harvest in Mato Grosso advanced 15% last week.  The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported that the fasted harvest is in the mid-north region where 93% of the corn has been harvested.  The slowest harvest pace is the southeastern region where 54% of the corn has been harvested.

	The corn harvest pace in Parana continues to be very slow.  The harvest pace in the state advanced 14% last week, but it is still only 20% complete compared to 57% complete last year.  The safrinha corn in Parana was planted later than normal and cold and wet weather slowed the maturation of the corn and the dry down of the grain.

	We will get the newest estimates of the Brazilian corn crop in about ten days.  Conab will release their August Crop Estimate on Thursday, August 9th.  In their July Crop Report, Conab lowered their 2017/18 Brazilian corn production 2.0 million tons to 83.0 million.  The USDA will release the August WASDE report on Friday, August 10th.  In the July WASDE, the USDA lowered their Brazilian corn estimate by 1.5 million tons to 83.5 million.  I am anticipating that both Conab and the USDA will lower their Brazilian corn estimate again in August.
