Cotton in Mato Grosso Could also Suffer from Dry Weather 
<p>
	Mato Grosso is the largest cotton producing state in Brazil and the full season cotton crop is in good condition at the present time.  The crop is tall and robust and the cotton is now flowering and starting to set bolls.  Only a very few bolls are starting to open and the harvest won't begin until later in June.  The full season cotton crop will also need additional rainfall to meet its yield potential.

	A small, but significant portion of the cotton crop in Mato Grosso was planted as a second crop after soybeans.  It too was planted later than normal due to delays in harvesting the soybeans.  The <i>safrinha</i> is between one to two feet high and still developing vegetative.  It is in good condition at the present time, but its full yield potential will only be reached with additional rainfall.  If more rains aren't forthcoming, it is the <i>safrinha</i>cotton crop that will be most affected.

	The total cotton production in Brazil will be larger than last year without a doubt due to the nearly 60% increase in cotton acres, but the cotton yields in 2011 are going to be challenged by the early onset of dry weather.
