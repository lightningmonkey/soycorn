2021 U.S. Corn Yield Unchanged at 175.5 bu/ac
<p>
The 2021 U.S. corn yield was left unchanged this week at 175.5 bu/ac, and I have a neutral bias going forward, at least for the time being.

	The weather during the first half of July has generally been favorable for the corn with the exceptions of continued dry conditions in parts of the northwestern Corn Belt and too much rain in parts of the central Corn Belt.  Most of the rainfall over the weekend occurred in the southern and eastern areas with only limited amounts in the northwestern Corn Belt.

The forecast now is for warmer and dryer conditions.  A week of warm and sunny weather would be beneficial for most of the corn except for the dry areas in the northwestern Corn Belt.  If it stays dry for more than a week, it could start to be detrimental especially if the temperatures heat up in the western Corn Belt.

	The 2021 U.S. corn is 56% silking compared to 55% last year and 52% average.  This is an increase of 30% from last week.  The corn is 8% in dough compared to 8% last year and 7% average.

	Corn yields in the eastern Corn Belt are on track to be very good if the weather cooperates during August.  In the northwestern Corn Belt, corn yields will be below trend, it is just a matter of how much.  North Dakota has 3.6% of the U.S. corn acres, South Dakota has 6.1% and Minnesota has 8.8%.  Combined, these three states have 18.5% of the U.S. corn acres.
