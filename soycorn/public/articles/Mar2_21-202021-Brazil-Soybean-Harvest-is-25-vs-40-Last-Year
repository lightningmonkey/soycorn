2020/21 Brazil Soybean Harvest is 25% vs. 40% Last Year
<p>
Brazilian farmers had harvested 25% of their 2020/21 soybeans as of late last week according to AgRural.  This represents an advance of 10% for the week, but it is still far behind the 40% harvested last year at this time.  Delayed planting and excessive rainfall during February has kept the current harvest pace the slowest in ten years.

	The harvest is picking up as more soybeans mature and the harvest weather improves in parts of southern Brazil as well as in parts of the center-west.  The forecast is calling for more rainfall across northern Brazil, but dryer conditions in parts of southern Brazil, which should allow farmers to keep harvesting at a moderate pace.  The harvest advanced 10% last week and it should advance at least that much if not more during the current week.
