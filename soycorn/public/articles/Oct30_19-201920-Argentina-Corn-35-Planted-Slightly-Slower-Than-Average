2019/20 Argentina Corn 35% Planted, Slightly Slower than Average
 <p>
	Most of the improved moisture situation in Argentina has been in the central and eastern areas.  This is also the area where the corn planting is most advanced.  The driest areas of Argentina continue to be in the southern and western areas although the dry areas did receive some rainfall over the weekend.

	Farmers in Argentina had planted 34.6% of their nationwide intended corn acreage as of late last week according to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange.  This represents an advance of 6% for the week and the corn planting is now a little slower than average.  In the core production areas, the corn is 85-90% planted with 20-30% planted in southern Argentina and not much corn has been planted in northern Argentina.

	Corn is planted in two phases in Argentina with the first phase planted in September and October and the second phase planted in December and January.  The first phase of corn planting is about 57% complete compared to 71% average, so the corn planting is a little slower than average.  The emerged corn is rated 9.6% poor to very poor and 37.6% good to excellent, which is a better rating than last year at this time.  The soil moisture for the corn is rated 33% short to very short and 19% optimum to surplus.
