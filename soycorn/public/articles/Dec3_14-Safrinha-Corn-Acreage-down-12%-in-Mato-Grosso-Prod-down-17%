Safrinha Corn Acreage down 12% in Mato Grosso Prod. down 17%
<p>
	In their first estimate of the 2014/15 corn crop in the state of Mato Grosso, the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) estimated that the safrinha corn acreage in the state will decline 12% (392,000 hectares) to 2.8 million hectares.  The primary reason for the decline is the delayed soybean planting which will result in delays in getting the second crop of corn planted. The delayed soybean planting may push planting of the second crop of corn past the ideal planting window which closes about February 20th.  Any corn planted after that date runs the risk of severe moisture deficits before the crop has time to mature.

Additionally, continued low international corn prices along with high freight costs reduces the profit potential for corn farmers in the state.

	Imea also estimated that the delayed planting and reduced use of technology will result in lower corn yields in 2014/15 (-6%)  They estimate the 2014/15 corn yield will be 86 sacks per hectare (79 bu/ac) compared to last year's yield of 91.6 sacks per hectare (84.6 bu/ac).  The total corn production in the state is expected to decline 17.6% from 17.7 million tons in 2013/14 to 14.5 million tons in 2014/15.

	The first official estimate of the state's 2014/15 corn crop will come from Conab probably in their February Report.
