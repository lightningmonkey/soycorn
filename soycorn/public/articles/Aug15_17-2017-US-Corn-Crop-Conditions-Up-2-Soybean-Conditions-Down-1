The soil moisture has improved slightly for the second week in a row, and given the wetter forecast for later this week, maybe the nationwide soil moisture bottomed out two weeks ago.  The cooler temperatures have helped to hold down the water demand of the crops, which has helped to extend the available soil moisture supplies.
