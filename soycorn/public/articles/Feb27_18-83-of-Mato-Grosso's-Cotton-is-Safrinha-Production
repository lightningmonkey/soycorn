83% of Mato Grosso's Cotton is Safrinha Production
<p>
In addition to being the largest soybean and corn producing state in Brazil, Mato Grosso is also the largest cotton producer as well.  The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) estimates that 92% of the intended cotton acreage in the state has been planted, which is 4% less that last year at this time.

	The Cotton Producers Association of Mato Grosso (Ampa) estimates that farmers in the state will plant 783,000 hectares of cotton which is 25% more than the 626,000 hectares planted last year.  Of the total, 17% is full-season cotton planted in December and 83% is safrinha cotton planted after soybeans are harvested in January and February.

	Cotton acreage is increasing due to the relatively good prices for cotton compared to corn.  Safrinha cotton and safrinha corn compete for the same acreage mainly in western and southeastern Mato Grosso.  The majority of the increase in cotton acreage is believed to have come at the expense of safrinha corn. Many cotton producers also grow safrinha corn and they opted for more cotton and less corn this growing season.
