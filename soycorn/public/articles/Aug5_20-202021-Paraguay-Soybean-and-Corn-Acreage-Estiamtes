2020/21 Paraguay Soybean and Corn Acreage Estimates
<p>
Farmers in Paraguay have not fared as well in recent years as farmers in neighboring Brazil because a lot of the agricultural commerce in Paraguay is conducted in dollars.  Therefore, with a strong dollar, the local domestic grain prices did not get propped up due to a currency devaluation.
</p>
<p>
The soybean acreage in Paraguay might increase 2.8% in 2020/21 and the corn acreage might increase approximately 3.0%.  They don't plant much corn in Paraguay and much of what they do plant is safrinha production after soybeans.  Therefore, if the soybean acreage increases, it automatically offers a potential for more safrinha corn acreage.
</p>
<p>
The 2020/21 Paraguay soybean acreage is estimated at 3.6 million hectares (8.8 million acres), which is up 0.1 million hectares (0.2 million acres) compared to the 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres) planted in 2019/20 or 2.8%.  The 2020/21 soybean production in Paraguay is estimated at 10.2 million tons or 0.3 million tons more than the 9.9 million tons currently estimated for the 2019/20 growing season.
</p>
<p>
The 2020/21 Paraguay corn acreage is estimated at 0.82 million hectares (2.0 million acres), which is up 3% compared to last year.  The 2020/21 Paraguay corn production is estimated at 4.2 million tons, which is up 0.2 million tons or 5% compared to last year.
