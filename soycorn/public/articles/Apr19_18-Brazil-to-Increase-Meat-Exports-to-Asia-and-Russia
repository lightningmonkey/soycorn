Brazil to increase Meat Exports to Asia and Russia
<p>
	The Brazilian Minister of Agriculture, Blairo Maggi, has spent a considerable amount of time and efforts recently prying open new markets for Brazilian meat exports.  The Minister indicated in a communication earlier this week that Brazil is in the final stages of negotiations with Indonesia, South Korea, China, and Russia on sanitary standards needed to start exporting meat products to those countries.

A technical mission from Indonesia is spending this week in Brazil inspecting various beef processing facilities in a number of states in preparation for starting to import Brazilian beef.

South Korea is expected to open its market to Brazilian pork produced in areas of the State of Santa Catarina that have been declared free of foot and mouth disease without vaccinations.  The two countries are in the final stages of negotiations which could be completed within days.  The South Korean market is highly desirable due to the prices they are willing to pay for quality pork.

A technical mission from China is expected to tour various meat processing facilities in Brazil during early May.  The goal of the mission is to increase the number of facilities certified to export beef, pork, and poultry to China.

A meeting is scheduled between the Brazilian Minister of Agriculture and Russian sanitary officials next week to discuss the reopening of the Russian market to Brazilian pork.  Russia suspended Brazilian pork imports in December of 2017 alleging the presence of a banned growth stimulant in pork products.  The Brazilian Minister has sent a letter to the Russian authorities outlining the various measures that have been adopted in order to insure that Brazilian pork is free of the stimulant.  It is expected that Russia will accept the Brazilian assurances at their upcoming meeting.

The goal of many of efforts put forth by the participants in the Brazilian meat sector is to obtain the International Sanitary Certificate (CSI) for their meat products.  The CSI Certificate helps to insure high quality meat exports.

Brazil is the major exporter of beef and poultry in the world and a primary supplier of pork.
