Drought Severely Impacted Safrinha Corn in Northern Parana
<p>
	Corn farmers in northern Parana are facing a difficult safrinha corn harvest.  The crop was planted a month later than normal and then the summer rainy season ended earlier than normal.  In the municipality of Maringa in northern Parana, some areas were without rain for a period of 90-days.

	According to the President of the Rural Syndicate of Maringa, the average corn loss in the region will be 50% to 60% and in the areas with the least rainfall, the losses could be 80% to 100%.

<p>
The safrinha corn harvest will start in mid-July so there is still the potential for additional losses if a frost occurs within the next few weeks.

<p>
	Some of the farmers who forward contracted their anticipated corn production are going to have problems harvesting enough corn to meet their contracts.  This will force them to renegotiate their contracts with the grain companies.

The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) reported that 24% of the safrinha corn in Parana is mature and that 1% had been harvested.  Parana is the second largest safrinha corn producing state in Brazil after Mato Grosso
