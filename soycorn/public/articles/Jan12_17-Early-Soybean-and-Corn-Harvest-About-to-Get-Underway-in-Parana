Early Soybean and Corn Harvest about to get Underway in Parana
<p>
	Farmers in the state of Parana in southern Brazil are getting ready to start harvesting their 2016/17 soybean and corn crops.  According to the Department of Rural Economics (Deral), the soybeans in the state are 4% mature and the crop is rated 97% in good condition.  The first soybeans are expected to be harvested by the end of the week.  The weather has generally been good this growing season and expectations are for a good soybean crop.

	Deral is estimating that the state will produce 18.3 million tons of soybeans or 11% more than last year.

	Farmers in the state have already started to harvest the first few fields of their 2016/17 full-season corn.  Deral is estimating that 8% of the corn is mature with 94% of the corn rated in good condition and 6% in average condition.  The corn harvest pace will accelerate toward the end of January which is normal for the state.

	Deral is estimating the full-season corn crop at 4.37 million tons, which would represent an increase of 30% over last year's drought impacted crop.  Farmers in the state took advantage of high corn prices to trim back on their soybean acreage and to increase their full-season corn acreage by 20%.
