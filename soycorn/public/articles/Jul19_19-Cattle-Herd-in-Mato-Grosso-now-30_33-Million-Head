During the first semester of 2019 the number of cattle sent to market in the state also increased by 9.2% compared to the first semester of 2018, totaling 2.68 million head.  Carcass weights continue to increase while the age of the cattle declined indicating improved productivity

Cattle production costs also increased year-on-year due to higher cost of yearlings and higher feed costs.  The cost of yearlings over the past 12 months averaged R$ 1,362 per head or approximately $358 per head.  The cost of inputs increased as well as the cost of corn and soybean meal.

	There are various types of cattle production in Mato Grosso.  The majority of cattle are grass fed from start to finish.  Others are put on feed during the dry season and back on grass during the rainy season.  Others are put in the feedlots just to finish.
