Safrinha Corn Yields in Mato Grosso already Setting Records
<p>
Farmers in Mato Grosso have been expressed optimism concerning their safrinha corn crop for several weeks and that optimism appears to have been justified.  The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) has reported that early yield results in several areas of the state are pointing to record safrinha corn yields.

<p>
In their latest estimate of the safrinha corn crop in the state, Imea is estimating the statewide corn yield at 107.0 sacks per hectare (98.8 bu/ac).  This is approximately 4 bu/ac more than Conab's current yield estimate of the crop.  In 2017/18 the statewide corn yield was 90.2 bu/ac.  The high yields are being attributed to a record amount of corn being planted during the ideal planting window in addition to good rainfall during the critical developmental phases of the crop.

Some regions, such as northeastern and southeastern Mato Grosso, are reporting corn yields 17% and 12% greater than last year respectively.  Last year's corn yield were lower in these regions due to a lack of rainfall to finish off the crop.

<p>
The corn harvest is still in its early stage with approximately 5% of the crop harvested.  The corn harvest should wrap up by late July or early August.  The majority of the corn produced in the state goes into the export market, but recent increases in corn-based ethanol production in the state is consuming more of the crop domestically.  The state of Mato Grosso is Brazil's largest producer of soybeans, corn, cotton, and cattle.
