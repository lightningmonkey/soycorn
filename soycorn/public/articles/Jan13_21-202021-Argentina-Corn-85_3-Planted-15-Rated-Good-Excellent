2020/21 Argentina Corn 83.5% Planted, 15% Rated Good/Excellent
<p>
	The rainfall last week in Argentina was more concentrated in the southern areas and they offered modest relief from the dry conditions.  The forecast for this week is for improved chances of rainfall in the western, northwestern, and northern areas of Argentina with lighter amounts in the core production areas.

	Corn planting in Argentina was 85.3% late last week compared to 88% last year and 86.8% average.  This represented an advance of 10.5% for the week.  In the core production areas, the corn planting is complete while the corn is 85-90% planted in southern areas and 30-35% planted in far northern Argentina.  As of late last week, there were still about one million hectares of corn left to plant in Argentina and there is maybe two weeks left in the planting window.

	The condition of the corn was rated 15% poor to very poor, 70% fair, and 15% good to excellent late last week.  The good to excellent percentage compares to 17% last week and 55% last year.  The soil moisture for the corn was rated 22% short to very short and 78% favorable to optimum.  The favorable to optimum percentage compares to 74% last week and 88% last year.

	The early planted corn is about 50% pollinating and 30% filling grain and the late planted corn is still in vegetative development.

In the core production areas, the early planted corn is in the middle of filling grain and the region is considered 65% in drought.  The Rosario Grain Exchange reported that at the city of Pergamino in northern Buenos Aires, they are estimating worst case scenario corn yields in the range of 5,000 to 6,000 kg/ha (79.5 to 95.4 bu/ac) with a best case scenario yields of 8,000 kg/ha (127 bu/ac), but the best case will only be reached if they receive significant rainfall by the end of this week.  They indicated that the bottom 3-4 leaves of the corn are now dry as the plant takes nutrients from the lower leaves in order to help fill the grain, which is normal for corn in a drought.
