Attractive Prices Encourage Brazilian Farmers to Sell their Grain
<p>
Attractive domestic grain prices in Brazil continue to encourage Brazilian farmers to sell both their old crop and new crop grain production.  The attractive prices are the result of tight supplies, strong domestic demand, and a weaker Brazilian currency compared to the U.S. dollar.

According to the Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea), farmers in the state have sold 98.7% of their 2018/19 old crop corn production at an average price last week of R$ 30.43 per sack (approximately $3.40 per bushel).  For the new crop 2019/20 safrinha corn, which will be planted early in 2020, farmers are forward contracting their corn at R$ 23.50 per sack (approximately $2.60 per bushel).  These are very attractive prices considering that the cost of production for safrinha corn in Mato Grosso is in the range of $2.00 to $2.50 per bushel.
