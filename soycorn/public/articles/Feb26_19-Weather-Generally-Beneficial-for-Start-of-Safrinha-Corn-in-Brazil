Weather Generally Beneficial for Start of Safrinha Corn in Brazil
<p>
The weather last week was generally good for both the full-season corn and the safrinha corn.  There were good rains in Minas Gerais, which is a big full-season corn producing state and the full-season corn yields in Rio Grande do Sul are reported to be very good.

	The weather last week was a little more mixed for the safrinha corn crop.  There was good moisture across central Brazil where the safrinha corn has been planted at a record fast pace.  In fact, it was a little too wet in some areas of Mato Grosso where farmers are trying to finish their safrinha corn planting.  In general though, the safrinha corn is off to a good start in central Brazil.

	In southern Brazil, the safrinha corn planting is not as advanced and there continued to be some dry pockets in southern Mato Grosso do Sul and northern Parana, but there are rains in the forecast for that region.  You always have to be cautious about the safrinha corn crop because the eventual yields will be determined by the weather during April and May when the crop is pollinating and filling grain.

<b>Full-Season corn in Rio Grande do Sul</b> - According to Emater-RS, 41% of the full-season corn in Rio Grande do Sul has been harvested with another 16% ready for harvest.  Early corn yields are as high as 200 sacks per hectare (185 bu/ac) and if the weather continues to cooperate, the full-season corn yields could surpass initial estimates.

	<b>Full-Season corn in Parana</b> - The Department of Rural Economics (Deral) reported that 24% of the full-season corn had been harvested and the reaming corn was rated as 18% average and 82% good.

<b>Safrinha Corn in Mato Grosso</b> - The Mato Grosso Institute of Agricultural Economics (Imea) reported last Friday that 86% of the safrinha corn had been planted compared to 68% last year and 67% for the 5-year average.  This represented an advance of 12% for the week.  The fastest corn planting is in western Mato Grosso where 91% of the corn has been planted.  The slowest corn planting is in the south-central region where 74% of the corn has been planted.

In the municipality of Nova Mutum, which is located in central Mato Grosso, all of the soybeans will be followed by safrinha corn, but farmers have not been able to plant the last 20% of their corn because of wet weather.  The ideal planting window for safrinha corn in the region closed on February 20th, which was last Wednesday.  The soybean harvest in the municipality is 75% complete, which is a slowdown from the very fast start of the harvest.
